### Building GitHub with Ruby on Rails

[Original](https://github.blog/2023-04-06-building-github-with-ruby-and-rails/).
GitHub.com is written using Ruby on Rails and maintained by over a thousand engineers with almost 2 million lines of code. The company upgrades to the latest Rails commit weekly with pull requests and revision reviews. Benefits of these upgrades include better database connection handling and faster view rendering, improved security, and a lower risk of unknown issues. Testing of the latest versions identifies and fixes issues before release. The post is a GitHub Privacy Statement, containing information on product features, security, stories, pricing, resources, developer API, partners, platform, and support. The post appears to have no new information or events, and it is unclear why it's gaining attention.

### Perennial rice: Plant once, harvest again and again

[Original](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/23/1165680024/perennial-rice-plant-once-harvest-again-and-again).
Scientists have created perennial rice strains that stay productive and regrow after every harvest, resulting in huge environmental benefits, a lower carbon footprint, healthier soil, and farmers not having to resow. These strains, bred over the last two decades, have been tested and harvested for four years in a row by 45,000 smallholding subsistence farmers. Experts predict that if more farmers adopt the new varieties, the benefits could be great for the people who grow them, the environment, and the world's population who rely on rice as a staple food.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35481409).
Perennial rice can reduce methane emissions from rice fields. Livestock production has a significant environmental impact. Climate change will lead to food shortages and other issues. Methane from rice fields does not have a significant impact compared to other sources. Perennial rice has potential benefits but also challenges. Experts discuss agriculture and food production. The success of irrigated perennial rice is outlined. Perennial crops can save on labor and input costs. Perennial plants have benefits for soil and nutrient extraction.

### 60M Americans have taxes so simple the IRS could do them automatically

[Original](https://www.vox.com/23055489/irs-automatic-filing-prepopulated-returns).
At least 41% of American households, or 62 million tax filing units, could have their entire tax returns handled by the IRS through "pre-populated returns" with no further intervention necessary. The less conservative approach puts the number at 73 million returns, or 48%. The potential for automatic returns could save time and angst every year, making tax season more efficient. The article goes on to briefly cover other topics unrelated to taxes, such as the Catholic Church child sex abuse crisis and Tesla's cameras being under scrutiny. However, it mainly highlights unique solutions to significant problems, covered in the Future Perfect newsletter. The article remains neutral and informative, without any political or religious bias.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35476709).
60M Americans' taxes are simple enough for IRS to automatically calculate. Easiest way for IRS to earn money is auditing financially vulnerable. Intuit contributes to the phenomenon of opaque laws. IRS enforcement is limited, so low-income Americans are audited more. Recent tax changes mean less scope for itemized deductions. The IRS cannot maximize its automatic tax ability. IRS budget decreased, recently increased; some believe the extra funding will enable IRS to maximize revenue instead of targeting specific people. Proposal to tax based on X rate, file if disagree. Pre-populated returns would save time and money but are not foolproof. Corporate lobbying contributes to the current self-service tax system's complexity. Cash transaction sales tax deductions lack feasibility for automation. Tax preparation wastes billions of dollars and time.

### We need to tell people ChatGPT will lie to them, not debate linguistics

[Original](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/7/chatgpt-lies/).
The article discusses the issues surrounding large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which can lie to people and have bugs that resist fixing. The author argues that it is more important to warn people about the risks of using LLMs than to debate linguistics. Although LLMs can be useful, they are not sentient and cannot be trusted to provide factual information. The article raises ethical questions about whether or not we should encourage people to use LLMs despite their flaws. The author concludes that it is important to approach LLMs with caution and emphasizes the need to warn people that ChatGPT can lie.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35483823).
ChatGPT can mislead users and needs to be repeatedly told not to trust it. Its usefulness may be limited if the tendency to hallucinate isn't solved. ChatGPT lacks reasoning abilities and can generate false information. Some are excited about its potential advancements, but some criticize it for its lack of capability to abstract or reason. AI-generated text needs skepticism and should be seen as an assistant who is well-read but potentially prone to confabulation. However, ChatGPT is useful in generating code examples and answering complex queries. It offers accurate answers up to 99% of the time. Users must understand its limitations to avoid assigning more morality than needed to ChatGPT.

### Twitter won't allow retweeting tweets linking to Substack

[Original](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/the-dumb-reason-twitter-wont-allow-retweeting-tweets-linking-to-substack/).
Twitter has begun restricting tweets containing links to Substack.com in response to Substack's announcement of a new product, Notes, which will directly compete with Twitter. Users have noticed they cannot retweet or reply to tweets with Substack links, and Twitter has seemingly started blocking tweet-embedding in Substack posts. This restriction is believed to be Twitter's attempt to curb the reach of a rival on its platform. Twitter similarly began blocking links to competing social media platforms in December 2022. Substack has yet to respond to questions on this matter.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35482222).
Twitter banned retweets of tweets linking to Substack, with liking such posts suppressing discussion. The move has sparked criticism about free speech, Elon Musk's stance on it, and Substack's competition. Mastodon is seen replacing Twitter for some. Discussions on PR, social media addiction, and questionable practices are covered. No new technology or release is mentioned.

### NZ's biggest data breach shows retention is the sleeping giant of data security

[Original](https://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/statements-media-releases/new-zealands-biggest-data-breach-shows-retention-is-the-sleeping-giant-of-data-security/).
Over one million New Zealand drivers' licenses and passports were exposed in the Latitude Financial data breach; some records were up to 18 years old. New Zealand's Deputy Privacy Commissioner cites data retention as a critical issue in cybersecurity attacks, stating that businesses and organizations must limit the collection and retention of data they do not require. Agencies should establish a personal information retention schedule, and individuals should challenge organizations they provide information to about why and how it is being retained. Privacy needs to become a crucial business issue, with similar protection to health and safety. Latitude Financial is contacting all affected customers to notify of the breach and assist with resolution while also working with regulators to unravel the breach's details.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35478240).

### U.S. and China wage war beneath the waves over internet cables

[Original](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-cables/).
US and China are in a battle over undersea cables that transmit everything from emails to military secrets. The US government has intervened in at least six private undersea cable deals in the past four years to isolate China's high-tech sector and limit Chinese access to US technology. The White House recently awarded the Singapore-to-France cable contract to US-based SubCom, rather than China's HMN Tech, on security grounds. The US government's aggressive efforts to prevent Chinese espionage through undersea cables are disrupting plans by tech giants and causing turmoil in the industry. China is retaliating by delaying a Meta-backed cable project, the Southeast Asia-Japan 2 cable.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35481712).

### Replacing bad systems with bad systems

[Original](https://seths.blog/2023/04/replacing-bad-systems-with-bad-systems/).
In his blog post, Seth uses the metaphor of outdated parking meters to illustrate the need to rethink and improve bad systems. While replacing them may seem expensive, centralized systems like the Parkmobile app often have their own shortcomings. Going back to the original goal of generating revenue and preventing all-day parking, Seth suggests implementing a free app that scans a code to allow a period of parking time. Other revenue-enhancing options include an online payment service or selling parking passes with different discount options. While it's difficult to make UX choices for a public system, distributed systems like WordPress have thrived because of their decentralized and user-friendly design. The key benefit of distributed systems is their ability to improve over time, rather than calcifying like centralized systems. To move forward, Seth suggests that we prioritize better solutions instead of more solutions.

[HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35476350).
A simpler parking system in Denmark has manual clock faces, with fines for cheaters. Users point out similar systems overseas. Complex solutions are often used despite simple options. Chicago parking meters generated $200M in 10 years. New electronic parking meters are less convenient than the classics. Governments struggle with payment systems, sometimes leaving it to vendors. Parking meters are mainly used for money, but they also prevent all-day parking. The article had no point according to one commentator, while another criticizes the author.
