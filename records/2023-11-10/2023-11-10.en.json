    "originBody": "← SHREYANS.ORG WHAT I LEARNED GETTING ACQUIRED BY GOOGLE November 9, 2023 Our 10 person startup gets acquired by Google, we rebuild our product the Google way, and begin to understand that amazing things are possible at Google, if you play the Google game. A follow up to What I learned at Venmo and What I learned at Socratic As we started to raise Socratic’s Series B in 2017, we quickly learned that our focus on getting usage at the expense of revenue was going to bite us. Our growth got us in the door, but every VC asked for a monetization plan, and in the process of figuring that out we concluded that an education app focused on credit-card-less high school students wasn’t going to become a big business. Around the same time, we were introduced to Evan Spiegel, the CEO of Snapchat. Evan suggested a partnership to integrate our camera-based homework helper into their app. But one of our advisors figured that if he introduced you to their Head of Corporate Development, he may be suggesting an eventual acquisition, and if so, we should get a competitive process going. So we did, and reached out to Microsoft, Chegg, Byju’s, and Google. My co-founder, Chris, had previously worked at Google and reconnected with his past manager to get an intro to Lens - Google’s camera-first app. What we didn’t know was that she had recently started an education effort of her own, along with the co-founders of Khan Academy and Android. We met and learned that we had hugely overlapping visions for a learning-focused, AI-powered tutor. Maybe it helped that we had just won Google’s Android App of the Year, but soon after that meeting, we kicked off a process that led to Google acquiring Socratic in March of 2018. We merged with an existing team of the same size, composed of multiple long tenured Googlers. Chris and I became the product and engineering leads, tasked with building an AI-powered tutor and bringing those capabilities to Google’s largest products. Over the next three years, we rebuilt Socratic and relaunched it as “Socratic by Google”1, shipped Socratic features in Search and Lens, released a math solver and prototyped a step-by-step math tutor, and built capabilities that are being used across Google. Some things I learned along the way: Working at Google is like having a second passport. Go to any major city in the world and your badge2 unlocks a beautiful office with great food, desks, and a high speed link to every person in Google’s 200,000+ person network. And like visiting America as a foreigner, everything you see inside feels oddly familiar because of its massive exported influence, yet is just slightly different. Shockingly, you get immediate access to all of it. Access to their gigantic monorepo🔗 with billions of lines of code covering almost all their products. Live statuses of their globe-covering data centers. Strategy documents spanning two decades of history. And direct access to legends. Google does things the Google way. Just about every piece of software and infrastructure used at Google was built at Google, a natural result of facing the hardest engineering problems earlier than most companies. At Google's scale, the external world ceases to exist and is only rarely and carefully allowed to enter their walls. This meant that there was no chance of keeping our existing codebase. We would need to start from scratch, rediscovering our product insights with the new team, then rebuilding our app on Google’s stack. Problems we had already solved, like our ML system to classify the topics in a homework problem, had to be re-solved using Search techniques and to Search standards, which needless to say were higher than ours. One place we were able to break Google's mold was with ‘Ceebo’, our app mascot. Look at Google’s collection of app icons and you’ll see four colors and simple shapes. Works for them, but boring to us. They pushed (“we don’t anthropomorphize”), we pushed back (“you do with Android!”), until we finally got our way because we were too small to matter. Ceebo lives on as our app icon, and has blossomed within Google, where dozens of variants have been illustrated, and Ceebo pops up in surprising docs and sites all around Google. The usual Google app logos vs. Ceebo Simple things done repeatedly feel magical. Re-building our query classification system alongside Search veterans was an illuminating peek into how Search itself was built. On the one hand there’s the incredible depth of information retrieval tools, and the mind-boggling ability to calculate and add a new signal to every page on the Internet (e.g. contains_math, or subject:chemistry). On the other hand there was the discovery that most Search improvements are manually reviewed by engineers through ‘side-by-side’ comparisons between old and new results...on spreadsheets! One may expect Google engineering to largely consist of implementing PhD level algorithms, and while that's sometimes true, much of a search or AI engineer's job involves looking at examples, spotting patterns, hand labelling data, and other non-scalable, in-the-weeds analysis. This seems to be generally true among the best AI teams: \"One pattern I noticed is that great AI researchers are willing to manually inspect lots of data. And more than that, they build infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect data quickly. Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable intuitions about the problem.\"🔗 Most problems aren’t worth Google’s time, but surprising ones are. Most 10-50 million user problems aren’t worth Google's time, and don’t fit their strategy. But they’ll take on significant effort on problems that do fit their nature, strategy, and someone’s promotion goals. One such example: computer vision is a big part of Socratic’s interface, specifically being able to read text and math in images. As a startup we used a 3rd party tool, but between exposing sensitive data, expectations of scale, and a complex vendor review process - using it within Google proved too difficult. Sometimes it’s easier to just buy the company to bring the tech in-house. Other times, as in our case, there’s an AI research team that’s interested in the problem, hires a top PhD talent to work on it, and delivers a world-class math recognition API within 6 months. Of course, if you’ve read Steve Yegge’s classic blog post comparing Google and Amazon's platforms, you’ll know that this world class service was not externalized. Google is an ever shifting web of goals and efforts. Amazing things are possible at Google, if the right people care about them. A VP that gets it, a research team with a related charter, or compatibility with an org’s goals. Navigating this mess of interests is half of a PM’s job. And then you need the blessing of approvers like privacy, trust and safety, and infra capacity. It takes dozens of conversations to know if an idea is viable, and hundreds more to make it a reality. And that’s the happy path. Amazing things are possible at Google, if the right people keep caring about them. Team goals can change in any given quarter, and entire teams can disappear in the face of a 'reorg', a phenomenon so common that Googlers can look past the tragedy and see the comedy in it. Suppose you dodge all those bullets, you might still wake up to find that while you were working on your project, two distant teams were also working on the same idea, and the time has come to fight it out because only one can proceed. The internal users of the losing projects will find that the API they depended on is now ‘deprecated’, but the replacement, well it’s not quite ready yet. Googlers wanted to ship great work, but often couldn’t. While there were undoubtedly people who came in for the food, worked 3 hours a day, and enjoyed their early retirements, all the people I met were earnest, hard-working, and wanted to do great work. What beat them down were the gauntlet of reviews, the frequent re-orgs, the institutional scar tissue from past failures, and the complexity of doing even simple things on the world stage. Startups can afford to ignore many concerns, Googlers rarely can. What also got in the way were the people themselves - all the smart people who could argue against anything but not for something, all the leaders who lacked the courage to speak the uncomfortable truth, and all the people that were hired without a clear project to work on, but must still be retained through promotion-worthy made-up work. Top heavy orgs are hard to steer. Another blocker to progress that I saw up close was the imbalance of a top heavy team. A team with multiple successful co-founders and 10-20 year Google veterans might sound like a recipe for great things, but it’s also a recipe for gridlock. This structure might work if there are multiple areas to explore, clear goals, and strong autonomy to pursue those paths. But if you want to work on one unified product, it needs a clear leader, with a clear direction, and more doers than thinkers. And counter-intuitively, adding more people to an early-stage project doesn't make it go faster. Technical debt is real. So is process debt. Engineers are used to talking about technical debt: a corner that you cut today to save time and ship a feature; a loan from your future self that is either paid back in time or it slowly gets more expensive to deal with. Good teams regularly pay down debt by cleaning things up on quieter days. Just as real is process debt. A review added because of a launch gone wrong. A new legal check to guard against possible litigation. A section added to a document template. Layers accumulate over the years until you end up unable to release a new feature for months after it's ready because it's stuck between reviews, with an unclear path out. In some rare cases, process is rolled back: Google recently changed their onerous perf(ormance review) process, from twice a year to once, from a long to a short questionnaire, and hopefully from 30+% of a manager's year to less than 10%. And sometimes an external threat either forces this change, or precipitates a company's decline. Google invented the technologies behind ChatGPT, but wasn't the one to release that product. Now it must resolve the growing tension between the builders that want to reclaim Google's AI lead, and the reviewers that want to guard against all possible troubles🔗. Amazing things are possible at Google, if you play the right game. Google used to have a set of internal values they called \"The Three Respects\": respect the user, respect each other, and respect the opportunity. The first two are somewhat easy to understand, but the third one confused most people. My interpretation is as follows: you're at Google, an insanely profitable, genius-filled enterprise. You're well-paid, well-fed, and live in the eternal spring paradise of Silicon Valley. What's the best thing you can do with this insane luck? And my answer to that question echoes what Richard Hamming said in You and Your Research🔗: you must find the most important problem in your field, and play whatever games necessary to solve it. Practically, what this means is to first do the work that is given to you. But once that's under control, to reach out into the vast Google network, to learn what's being planned and invented, to coalesce a clear image of the future, to give it shape through docs and demos, to find the leaders whose goals align with this image, and to sell the idea as persistently as you can. To some extent I did this. One of my favorite examples was a demo for a step-by-step math tutor, built on top of our new math solver, made by three of us on the side over a few months. The demo gave our vision for intelligent tutoring a tangible form - it had a link, it could be used, it could be shared. It grounded conversations, gave people something specific to react to, and took on a life outside our team, being passed around, independently discussed, and leading back to us. I also saw this go wrong. One of our leaders clearly saw the world we were heading towards, had designers make great demos, and would share them whenever he could. But he was trapped in the wrong part of the company, and his boss's goals pointed elsewhere. He eventually switched to a more compatible team, and his dream now has a chance of becoming a reality. Many acquisitions fail. Socratic's story is mixed. On one hand, we managed to merge two vastly different cultures, our product lives on and has grown to serve ~5 billion queries a year, and careers across the Socratic team have bloomed. On the other, both Chris and I left Google to found startups3, and neither the Socratic team nor Google as a whole have yet produced an AI powered tutor worthy of Google's capabilities. But a few Socratic Googlers might yet make it happen, unless they've been re-org'd. Thanks to Avni, Shantanu, Rich, Harish and the entire 10x team for the opportunity, and to the Socratic team for being such great compatriots in this chapter. 14.9 stars with half a million ratings. Blows my mind. Socratic on the App Store 2Google’s most visible class system is seen through their badges. White badges are for full time employees. Green badges are for interns. And red badges are for Temps, Vendors, and Contractors - TVCs - who do work ranging from the mundane to the critical, sit alongside the white badges, number over 100,000, but have limited benefits and access (a source of many issues) and often cannot publicly state that they worked at Google. 3Chris recently founded Granola, building AI powered workspaces, and I'm the co-founder and CTO of Maven, building the university of tomorrow.

It was really weird having TVCs on your team. You&#x27;d all work hard together to launch a thing, and then everybody except the red badge would get a celebratory team tchotchke or a team lunch or something. If you asked about it, the manager would say \"we can&#x27;t give Jim things directly because that might be like compensation and they&#x27;d be like an employee.\" There&#x27;d be all-hands meetings they couldn&#x27;t go to, or seemingly arbitrary doors they couldn&#x27;t open or internal sites they couldn&#x27;t see. If you worked with a TVC, you&#x27;d get training that felt like you were learning how to own a House Elf: \"Remember, never give them clothing or they&#x27;ll be free! And report them if they ever claim to work for Google.\" reply slater- 15 hours agoparentthank you for mentioning this.i was a red badge. it was fucking demeaning. i have a lot of stories, but my favorite was when everyone on my floor got an earthquake safety kit except me. literally google didn&#x27;t care if i lived or died.the expectation was that if i sucked up enough (\"demonstrated my value\") they MIGHT make me a real boy, like some bizarre Velveteen Rabbit fetish game.i loved watching how Google would continuously pat themselves on the back about how good they are to \"their employees,\" and then openly shit on the people who worked full time at the company but technically weren&#x27;t FTEs.it&#x27;s a caste system. a company that behaves this way should be run out of town with extreme prejudice. but instead they somehow took over San Francisco. reply peddling-brink 15 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t just google, it&#x27;s every company with contractors and employees.Microsoft learned the hard way to not treat contractors like employees. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;businesspropicks-us-findlaw-...Nobody else wants to learn that same lesson. reply JSavageOne 14 hours agorootparentOk but then contractors have the freedom to work whatever hours they want, not show up to the office, and subcontract out their work - right? If so that might be more appealing than being an employee reply no_wizard 14 hours agorootparentNot in practice, because they use a hiring entity to dictate the terms. You&#x27;re expected to show up on a schedule, do the work etc. much like a FTE, but you&#x27;re not an FTE.I think some folks have this illusion of software contractors that this is somehow common, it really isn&#x27;t. The norm is you-are-almost-but-not-quite an employee type work environment, and thats at the better places.I&#x27;ve worked at a place where contractors were treated like they weren&#x27;t human, basically. Worst equipment, forced to work in an old warehouse that barely passed code to be considered retrofitted for an office, people routine got sick out there because they were exposed to the elements. Not to mention, during fire season (this was California) they were in a building that didn&#x27;t have a good enough air filtration system, so they were forced to sit in smoke all day, more or lessI quit that place pretty quickly, but it was nothing short of terrible reply kelnos 13 hours agorootparentI think the GP&#x27;s point was that&#x27;s how it should be. If a company is going to -- for \"legal reasons\" -- not treat contractors the same way they treat employees, then they should be doing so not only in bad, exclusionary ways, but also in good ways, with the expected perks of being a contractor that FTEs don&#x27;t get: freedom to set their own hours, work where they want, and subcontract out their work.But no, companies like Google want to have their cake and eat it too: they want a class of workers where they can require of them more or less the exact same things that they require of their employees (and much more easily fire them), but can give them a lot less, and treat them like a second class.That&#x27;s entirely Google&#x27;s choice. It does not have to be that way. But they&#x27;ve decided to create this two-class system for their own benefit, not for anyone else&#x27;s.Also consider that these people are probably often not contractors in the legal sense. They&#x27;re likely W-2 employees of some sort of staffing agency, who are then placed at Google. Google pays the staffing agency, the staffing agency pays the \"contractor\" a salary (significantly less than what Google pays the staffing agency), and all is fine... legally, anyway. reply ssharp 12 hours agorootparent>> Google pays the staffing agency, the staffing agency pays the \"contractor\" a salary (significantly less than what Google pays the staffing agency), and all is fine... legally, anyway.The staffing agency vig is so high it is practically the same as an FTE. reply Galacta7 11 hours agorootparentI used to work for a temp agency (clerical, not in tech) and I remember once seeing what my agency was getting paid for me on an hourly basis. Iirc, it was something like 3-4x what I was getting paid hourly. It was kind of sickening tbh. Plus many agencies forbid temps from being hired away without paying an outrageously hire fee to do so.It felt like being an indentured servant in many ways. The only upside was that if you hated the place you worked, you could always ask to be reassigned someplace else. But that&#x27;s the only major plus I can think of. reply ethbr1 7 hours agorootparentAfaicr, 3x was pretty standard in consultant salary vs billable rate.The idea is that covers 70-80% utilization, unprofitable engagements, HR, benefits, etc. Plus profit to the company. reply intended 6 hours agorootparentprevI’m assuming Profit margins are about 14-25%, so a 4x multiplier would be what it takes.3 would mean your firm had sources of revenue other than services&#x2F;consulting. reply dchftcs 6 hours agorootparentThe most profitable consulting-type businesses have profit margins >=50%, before distributing profits to equity holders. But either way I&#x27;m not sure about your implicit assumption here that the profits should be comparable to the pay of the employees. reply intended 2 hours agorootparentHey, you began your comparison with the most profitable consulting firms…2 things -1) Accenture has an EBIT of 20%.2) The tippy top of the consulting pyramid plays on branding in a way that the average firm does not.The VAST majority of service driven firms will not become McKinsey etc. making this a poor comparisonFinally - I doubt that the top firms have those margins, I would most definitely like to be corrected though. If you could clarify or share your source, I’d appreciate it. reply scottru 8 hours agorootparentprevFWIW, this isn&#x27;t the case at Google (or many other large technology companies). Google dictates the staffing agency markup (which is very limited) and audits for compliance.This, among many other processes, has significant negative impacts on the quality of the agency that will work with Google on this sort of work - but it does help with cost control.(Source: I ran one of these agencies, and Google was a past client.) reply ClumsyPilot 7 hours agorootparentWith that level of control by Goofle, the entire thing comes across as a legal charade at best, or fraudulent at worst. reply meheleventyone 2 hours agorootparentprevContractors should cost more than a FTE you’re buying expertise and the contractor is shouldering the risk and burdens of not being a FTE. reply saagarjha 1 hour agorootparentYeah, except the contractor sees none of that money if they go through a staffing agency. reply ethbr1 14 hours agorootparentprevAs a contractor, you are an FTE... just for a different (almost always much worse) company.And that arrangement exists solely so that the company whose work you&#x27;re actually doing can fire you more easily or avoid legal liability. reply JSavageOne 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m surprised this even legally flies. Seems like the legal equivalent of creating a shell company. reply adharmad 10 hours agorootparentIt is a shell company, except that it is not Google (or its equivalent) who is creating it. It is the Infosys and Cognizants (or other bodyshopping firms) of the world who create this structure to satisfy the demand created by the Googles. reply lmm 11 hours agorootparentprevThe US loves its purely procedural legal distinctions. Shell companies are often not only legal but encouraged. reply tick_tock_tick 9 hours agorootparentprevI mean classic example are contracting out food service in the corporate cafeteria. You contract the work to some random other company who hire people to do food service or do you want Google or whoever to start hiring cooks themselves? Janitorial staff is also a classic role for this style of employment. reply whatshisface 9 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s quite different - Google contracts for a service to be provided and takes no interest in managing janitors and cooks individually. The red badgers sound like they&#x27;re being given individual instructions but denied employee protection. reply hef19898 1 hour agorootparentTwo different kind of outsourcing contracts. And red badgers, unless they are freelancers, have employee protection. Just not from Google, or any other company using subcontracting agencies for that matter. reply chii 7 hours agorootparentprevbut looking at it from a top down perspective, it does seem like google treats these contractors no better than the janitors and cooks. So i dont think you can say it&#x27;s different merely because the nature of the work is not the same. reply whatshisface 5 hours agorootparentGoogle doesn&#x27;t treat janitors any way. They treat the building services company. They do treat the contract programmers a certain way. reply bradleyjg 8 hours agorootparentprevThe difference between a legitimate third party service and these ought-to-be-illegal body shop arrangements is whether Google is paying for a specific service—e.g. clean offices—or people that they boss around. reply ClumsyPilot 7 hours agorootparentprev> or do you want Google or whoever to start hiring cooks themselves?Yes? Whats wrong with hiring a cook if you need to cook? reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentBecause Google has no idea how to manage or hire cooks? reply ayewo 6 minutes agorootparentGoogle&#x27;s first chef Charlie Ayers was hired way back in 1999https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Charlie_Ayers vasco 1 hour agorootparentprevGoogle managed to hire their first chef in 1999 and manage them directly, I&#x27;m sure they can manage a global team of cooks better than anyone else if they wanted to, because of their specific needs and so many global offices to spread the gains through. It&#x27;s all just a decision they took. reply astrange 2 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s just as easy to hire a chef as it is to hire a catering service. reply rewmie 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat surprises me the most is how a corporation like Google is incapable of meeting temporary staffing needs internally, by shifting people already on their payroll around projects. It&#x27;s as if they are just admitting that they are shit at managing projects and workloads and scoping work to the point that they need external help to plug these gaping holes in their load management.How many people do they need to pay to manage this contractor circus? How much effort do they waste sourcing contractors, tracking work assigned to them, treat contractors differently even interns of security processes, and dealing with higher attrition levels? So much waste. reply GreedClarifies 13 hours agorootparentprevI wish we could somehow get this comment more visibility. Especially the 1st sentence.People that complain about the plights of contractors need to understand the above. reply edgyquant 14 hours agorootparentprevThat’s not legally a contractor then. As someone who has done contracting, both for software and in construction plus has hired them and had to be advised by lawyers around the legality of what makes or breaks a contractor…If you are setting their hours, bossing them around and&#x2F;or providing equipment they are not a contractor they are an employee. This is the law in 100% of the United States. reply jasode 13 hours agorootparent>That’s not legally a contractor then. [...] If you are setting their hours, bossing them around and&#x2F;or providing equipment they are not a contractor they are an employee.There are 2 different uses of \"contractor\":(1) contractor : official IRS tax classification of 1099 independent contractor(2) \"contractor\" : a W-2 employee of a \"temp agency\" or \"staffing agency\" or \"bodyshop\" that is sent to a client company (such as Google) needing contingent workers. Adecco[1] is an example of a staffing company that sends people to Google. These temp agencies with workers classified as W-2 employees act as legal cover to \"avoid repeating Microsoft lawsuits\". From Google&#x27;s perspective, these Adecco employees are \"contractors\".If the above working arrangement looks convoluted with the economic inefficiencies of paying for an extra middleman (the temp agencies), it is. But it cleverly avoids the IRS claiming, \"Hey Google, your so-called contractors are misclassified and should be employees!\" ... and Google can say, \"They already are employees! They&#x27;re Adecco employees!\"The \"1099 real contractor\" is not as common as \"fake-contractor-but-really-somebody-elses-W2-employee\" ... because the \"1099 contractors\" won their lawsuit against Microsoft.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adeccousa.com&#x2F; reply Tangurena2 10 hours agorootparentThe tax reform act of 1986 removes the safe-harbor provision for engineers and programmers. This strange sentence means that if a company hires an engineer or programmer - as an independent contractor - and the IRS later decides that this person is really an employee, then the company is liable for back taxes and probably penalties. For other professions, the \"safe harbor\" provision means that the company is only liable for paying the employer share of taxes going forwards - the previous stuff is handwaved away.In effect, this scares companies so much that it is very difficult to get hired as a 1099 contractor as a programmer&#x2F;engineer. The vast majority of companies will require you to be a W-2 employee of some other company (which will be the \"staffing agency\" or \"bodyshop\" or \"temp agency\").One programmer was driven to fly his aircraft into an IRS building due to this issue.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;us&#x2F;19crash.htmlhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2010_Austin_suicide_attack reply bradleyjg 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy is it that w-2 employees of a different company can’t be invited to a lunch or given a tchotchke?I get why 1099s can’t but what’s the deal with the other, now more common situation? reply saagarjha 1 hour agorootparentIIRC they can, but only if the other company is also paying some proportion of the costs relative to how many of their employees are present, or something like that. It&#x27;s been a little while but the rules are in some training presentation or other. reply mtnGoat 6 hours agorootparentprevThey could be, but that creates taxable events and other issues&#x2F;complications&#x2F;liabilities. Easier to just avoid and be clear of it. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentprevBecause this [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;businesspropicks-us-findlaw-...] reply Consultant32452 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m a mostly fake contractor. I miss the good old days when I could fake contractor directly to companies. Now I have to go through a middle-man that takes a cut. I still make triple what I was making before, but it bothers me that the middle man is likely taking 30-50% off the top.These laws do not protect workers, they protect entrenched wealthy body shops. reply ponector 13 hours agorootparentprevHow would you call people who are hired by bodyshop(IT service providers like Infosys, Cognizant, Epam) and then leased to Google? reply vasco 1 hour agorootparentI call them exploited emigrants reply bozhark 12 hours agorootparentprevYou cannot dictate those terms of a contractor. reply BeetleB 14 hours agorootparentprev> Ok but then contractors have the freedom to work whatever hours they want, not show up to the office, and subcontract out their work - right? If so that might be more appealing than being an employeeDepends on the agreement. First off, probably 99% of these contractors work for a contracting company, so as a contractor you have no say: You are an employee of (another) company and they&#x27;ll set the rules.If you&#x27;re truly independent, then sure - try to make whatever agreement you want with Google. reply secondcoming 12 hours agorootparentprevNo, not really. reply ponector 13 hours agorootparentprevEvery US company. European companies somehow have contractors without caste system.Obviously there are different policies for internals and contractors, but fruits and pizza are for everyone in the office. reply rightbyte 13 hours agorootparentWhich is because it is extremely rude, like meanest of meanest, to not share food with each other. Like, of all mean but not illegal things you can do to contractors, not sharing food is probably what people consider the worst. Small every day things are way more provocative than abstract things like retirement funds or whatever.Been there. Done that. The FTEs got strawberries. I didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think I have been that pissed off in my life. If someone had wrecked my car on purpose I&#x27;d be less pissed. reply jterrys 9 hours agorootparentI experienced something similar at a previous job. It was funny. I was working in a satellite office for an org based in a different country, and once in a while (minimum once a year) we&#x27;d be sent to HQ for a few weeks. Wrapping up projects, team coordination, whatever. So of course we&#x27;d eat together.The team got a new manager when I joined, and he was told that our treatment was equal despite satellite office status because we were on the same teams coordinating on the same projects, but in different timezones.Anyway, even though I was technically a FTE at the company, I didn&#x27;t have the necessary prerequisites to pay for cafeteria food at FTE discounts. I was forced to pay contractor prices. A full extra $5 per meal. My manager was initially confused, then upset. Then we tried to talk with the cafeteria contracting company. They told him it was out of their control. So, we began investigating...eventually uncovering some internal \"separate but equal\" undocumented employment scheme were compensation, benefits, whatnot, unraveled into a weird caste discrimination system. The people that were pulling their weight were paid pennies while senior team members who were awaiting retirement just raked in the big bucks with benefits on contracts no longer offered, or offered through some backdoor deals before the company really expanded.In the end, the lunch situation was solved by just stating that I was a FTE because I had the same color badge.

In fact, ESA is not bound by any real-world law, either local or national—it’s governed only by its 130-page Convention and a set of internal regulations.

There are many unhoused people spread across rural city centers and the outer banlieues of Paris. College is vastly more restricted in France and unavailable to the majority of the population.

To be clear, passing down an entire home tax free in a highly developed nation is a huge financial advantage. Literally: 1,000+ EURs per month, for life would be saved. Why do so many people on HN think this should be normal to allow? In my eyes, this is the path to Old World aristocracy. The purpose of inheritance taxes is to reduce this advantage.I can guess what the reply&#x2F;replies will be: \"Oh, but housing is more expensive now.

France has solved that problem: Make it illegal to take statistics on ethnic origins, let the poors of the world come flood your land, let them work for lower wages, and then act surprised when their culture is fundamentally incompatible with yours. Your streets are now unfamiliar. Unsafe. Dirty. They don&#x27;t share your values of cleanliness and respect. Your freedom of expression. Don&#x27;t worry. Their children won&#x27;t be able to inherit their homes either.

Meaning the economy is way better with some inheritance present than without inheritance.Love is a powerful thing and while most people would agree with you that in theory they&#x27;d like all children to have the same opportunities, once their babies are born they will fight forever to give them the best conditions they can.I agree with inheritance taxes, probably not 100%, but wanted to explain the perspective of people that want full untaxed inheritances. reply ragall 7 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]It is financially unfeasible for most middle class households to pass down their homes to their children due to the estate tax kicking on assets over 100,000 eur.Inheritance tax for children caps at 20%.

In which case our feelings about these new insults might be complicated. But if the goal of a regulation is \"do less X\", and the chosen mechanism is \"you must insult other people when you do X\", I&#x27;d call that questionable policy design.Coming back from the metaphor, it seems more accurate to say that this regulatory situation with contractors wasn&#x27;t explicitly designed at all, but rather \"emerged\" out of previous policies and court decisions.

It&#x27;s not even a perverse incentive resulting from the ruling.

The status quo was that you could treat a contractor like an employee in everything but pay and benefits (like healthcare), and they were still a contractor.A court ruling decreed that was no longer the case, so now for companies to have contractors at all they must draw a bright-line demarcation in perks between FTEs and TVCs. A line that is frequently dehumanizing, because dehumanizing is visible and easy to argue in a court of law.Anyone who predicted any other outcome was naive, and those of us who want this silly pageant to end should be agitating for a law that functionally bans contracting. reply shadowgovt 12 hours agorootparentprevNot unlike how the GDPR resulted in banners everywhere, because the law stops short of banning contracting, companies have, of course, sought the optimal just-up-to-the-edge balance.The biggest two reasons it matters (i.e. two biggest disincentives from just hiring contractors) are healthcare and quarterly reports. Healthcare provision is very expensive, even amortized across the employees in a company, and TVCs get no healthcare from the client company. And the client company can grow and shrink TVC contracts all day long without having to tell shareholders they went through a mass hiring cycle or a layoff cycle. reply bcrosby95 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s weird that we look down on people acting like massive pricks to save money in their personal lives.

They needed some airspace data importers urgently and knew I could do it based on my past work for Google and my experience as a pilot. So we met for lunch, talked about the project, and that was that.I actually thought the \"temp\" thing was a brilliant hack: we agreed on a decent rate (paid through Adecco), and if they liked my work and I liked working with them, I could convert to FTE at some point (and this was true at the time).Then in August 2019 a memo came out that Temps were no longer eligible for FTE conversion. Even those who were hired with promises of that possibility.And yes, the memo was exactly as you said. The people you&#x27;d worked with closely for the last year, who hired you because you were just the person they needed and you already were doing a great job for them? They couldn&#x27;t vouch for you or communicate with the hiring panel at all.It would be a grind through the standard Google interview process, as if you had no history with the team you are already working with and delivering for.What kind of a fucked-up system is that?The thing that stung the most was that the memo also explained in detail that Interns were and remained eligible for FTE conversion, without any kind of full interview round like a Temp would have to endure.

Person directly employed on an ongoing basis. The employer pays all insurances, professional memberships and generally contributes to the professional development of the employee.2. Person directly employed on a fixed-term basis. The employer must offer employment on an ongoing basis if the employee has been engaged for a certain period of time. The employer pays all insurances, professional memberships and generally responsible for professional development of the employee (but generally more limited than what is available to employees under option (1)).3. Person contracted from a consulting firm, where the consulting firm directly employs the person on an ongoing basis. Once one client engagement ends, the consulting firm try to place the person with a different client as quickly as possible, and will keep paying the person during this process. The consulting firm pays all insurances, professional memberships and generally responsible for professional development of the employee.4. Person contracted from a labour hire firm, where the labour hire firm directly employs the person on a _casual_ fixed-term basis. The labour hire firm may be required to offer employment on an ongoing basis if the employee has been engaged for a certain period of time with a regular pattern of work apparent. The employee doesn&#x27;t have to accept (and it typically wouldn&#x27;t be in the persons or labour hire firms interests to do so). Labour hire employment agreements will typically specify a base rate and then a casual loading on top, so it is clear what the remuneration changes would be if casual employment is changed to ongoing employment (including if this occurs retrospectively). This option is generally used by professionals in unregulated professions such as ICT. Labour hire firms pay insurance, taxes, etc and clients and&#x2F;or employees generally provide facilities and tools of the trade.5. Person directly contracted through that person&#x27;s \"personal services income\" \"business\" (note: it&#x27;s technically not considered a business). This option is generally used by professionals in highly regulated professions such as medicine. The person&#x27;s \"business\" pays the person wages, insurances, professional memberships, and more commonly than (4) also facilities and tools of trade.For total remuneration benefits from highest to lowest, it&#x27;s generally (5) > (4) > (3) > (1) > (2). Ongoing employment of (1), (2) and (3) are generally detrimental versus casual employment of (4) and (5) because a person could be employed for 6 years and have accumulated months of personal&#x2F;sick leave and be close to having long service leave payable, and be forced out of their employment arrangement for an external reason such as a bad boss, a spouse needing to relocate or a family member some distance away needing care. When the person leaves their employer, they lose all accumulated benefits and start from scratch with their new employer. Options (4) and (5) ensure the person is no worse off when changing employers as the person has been paid the benefits upfront on a continuous basis, rather than waiting for a day that may never occur to obtain those benefits.For job security, there isn&#x27;t much difference. Sometimes directly employed persons are made redundant before labour hire persons. Sometimes it&#x27;s the opposite and labour hire persons are first to go. The main difference is whether a person gets 1 day notice and pay (casual employees of labour hire firms), 4 weeks notice and pay, or longer if a person has worked for the same employer for over a year. As employees have to change jobs every few years to grow a career and gain higher remuneration, the redundancy payouts for extended service are minimal compared to missed opportunity cost of not changing jobs. 1 day or 4 weeks notice and pay is negligible in the grand scheme of things, and most of the time labour hire employees would get much more than 1 day notice anyway to avoid the client gaining a bad reputation amongst the pool of labour hire employees.For the order in which people progress through these options in a professional career, it&#x27;s generally (2)|(1) > (3)|(4) > (5).For overall employment preference of professionals, I&#x27;d suggest perhaps most to least preferred of (4) > (5) > (3) > (1) > (2). (4) has less overhead and distraction of (5) as one can focus on their profession without having to worry about frequent changes to tax laws, changes to insurance policies, etc. But eventually to grow further, a professional would be required to switch from option (4) to option (5) and then may need to switch focus away from their profession and towards business priorities such as hiring support staff, engaging other professionals such as accountants, lawyers, insurance brokers, etc. (3) generally provides better remuneration and career growth over (1) and (2) because client engagements are shorter and more varied. But sometimes (1) is a good way to get a foothold into an industry or move into more senior positions (particularly management roles), and may make more sense than options (3), (4) and (5). reply wglb 8 hours agorootparentprevI had the same issue when I was a contractor at Allstate in the investment department.

When I first joined, \"we don&#x27;t discriminate based on the employment type\". The perm staff were wonderful in that regard. Then a new COO joined. He was a fucking sociopath. First we started getting locked out of various internal sites, needing to \"reapply\" for security reasons. Then they introduced the email badging that appended a big \"(EXTERNAL!)\" to your name in the address book. Then, if anyone attached anything to an email that included even one contractor as an addressee, they&#x27;d see a big WARNING! reminding them that they were potentially leaking the keys to the kingdom to us untrustworthy SOBs. Then in November a big rumour started going around that contractors were going to be \"surprised\" with a forced 6-week holiday (normal shutdown for contractors was 2 weeks over the break). I politely called out the COO directly on the internal Yammer, asking him to please put an end to the rumour mill and just confirm or deny whether it was true. I said the company would be within its rights to make that call but reminded him that \"contractors are people too\" and given the time of year, might want to know if their services weren&#x27;t needed in January. I got a bunch of support from employees (and the managers I worked for) - perm and contractor alike. Many perms were embarassed and apologetic for this outcasting of contractors (way to increase morale Mr.COO). Anyway, within 24 hours, I was pulled out of a meeting and escorted out of the building. The entire Yammer forum was nuked from orbit (I still have a couple of screenshots) and I ended up in their non-existent \"black book\". I know this latter point because in the intervening years I would occasionally get pinged by recruiters for roles at that bank. I&#x27;d laugh and told them I was probably still in the black book and to contact so-and-so to confirm whether I&#x27;d be welcomed back. They were always surprised when they did so and were bluntly told that I was not welcome.Since then I&#x27;ve been a perm at a couple of places were I had hiring responsibility and teams that included contractors and I ALWAYS made a point of treating them EXACTLY the same.

I&#x27;ve hired a quite a few contractors and there is usually two cases, I need workers, or expertise that is highly limited.Most contractors, not SME, are sourced from staffing agencies&#x2F;partners. Sure, the resource cost is on par with a salaried worker, but typically the staffing company sourcing these people are going to take a huge chunk on that contract, at least 1&#x2F;3. So yes, the resource&#x2F;person is 280K on paper, but it&#x27;s extremely rare they actually get paid that. The staffing agencies will provide benefits, but they&#x27;re not even close to what in house staff are getting.It also becomes nearly impossible to hire a contractor from partners in cases like this because you have to buy out the resource on the contract which is almost a non-starter because these fees can easily be 6 figures per head. reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparentThe staffing agencies benefits are always subpar and more expensive.And you’re right about the difference between “staff augmentation” contractors pay and SMEs. I just went into detail in a sibling reply.But to add on, the company I ended up being a tech lead at with a full time position. I came in at $65&#x2F;hour. I only took the job because I saw a chance to eventually wiggle my way into a tech lead role and I wanted to be on the ground floor of a green field project. I ended up working so much overtime - and getting paid for it - I made out pretty well compared to the local market. I got on my wife’s health insurance.I also mentioned that now that I am a SME on a niche but growing AWS service [1], I am able to charge $135 an hour for a side project and that’s a discount.[1] I beta tested the APIs while working at AWS and I was a major contributor on a popular open source official “AWS Solution” that’s built on top of it. reply scarface_74 14 hours agorootparentprevNot necessarily. I was a tech lead where I could only hire contractors. The run of the mill CRUD staff augmentation contractors were making about $65 and the contracting company was billing $100 a hour for them with no health care benefits, no PTO, no 401K match.On the other hand, the “cloud consultants”, who were just old school operations folks who only knew how to do lift and shifts and make everything more expensive were billing $200 an hour. It was a small shop owned by the partners.Long story short, I left there went to a startup for two years to get real world AWS experience, got hired at AWS in the ProServe department (full time job) and when I got Amazoned three years later (two months ago), I was able to negotiate a side contract with my former CTO for $135&#x2F;hour and even that was low.

I think the parent says that providing employee perks for your contractors _is_ violating the US labor law. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentBecause defacto treating them like employees means they are employees - with all associated benefits&#x2F;tax treatment.Which Microsoft would never have hired them, if that was the case, they would have hired normal FTEs.So either 1) hire contractors and treat them as contractors (without the employee style treatment), or be sued later. replyponector 13 hours agorootparentprevDo you really think that Google should not be blamed that in cutting costs they don&#x27;t want to provide same benefits for people they lease?If they had a will, they could easily force their vendors to provide same level of benefits.This is happening exactly to cut costs, to keep reported headcount low. There will be no news if Google cut 50000 of such contractors, simply because they are not counted, not treated like a people. Just a resource, leased from another company. reply gumby 14 hours agorootparentprev> Blame the courts, basically.No, blame these companies for trying hard to avoid workplace protection. reply hughesjj 14 hours agorootparentYup, these companies could always just hire outright reply esafak 11 hours agorootparentSo if they want to trim costs and not do that it would be better if they hired no-one?It is the same with undocumented workers. Would it better if they were deported than to be denied benefits afforded to citizens? reply lmm 10 hours agorootparentBy that logic it&#x27;s always fine for companies to get around labour protections.Yes, it would be better if they hired no-one. When your job conditions are beneath human dignity, you don&#x27;t get to hire people for that job, even if that means your stock price doesn&#x27;t grow quite as much and GDP is lower this year. reply esafak 8 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think workers generally agree with you. Certainly in the tech world, it is hard to describe contract work as \"beneath human dignity\". For blue collar work, I would understand your point. reply lmm 7 hours agorootparent> Certainly in the tech world, it is hard to describe contract work as \"beneath human dignity\".Realistically in the US the distinction is mainly about whether you have medical coverage. Plenty of people work with no or bad medical coverage because they are some combination of optimistic&#x2F;greedy&#x2F;desperate; to assess how humane that is you&#x27;d have to look at how they feel about it after getting diagnosed with something that they struggle to get decent treatment for because they weren&#x27;t an employee. replyajross 14 hours agorootparentprevNo, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with workplace protection or wages. The original suit was actually about participation in the stock purchase program (which in the mid-90&#x27;s was extremely lucrative at MSFT!), something that no contractor would normally expect to get. But because the contractors got free food at the cafe (or whatever), they did. Or rather they got a settlement making up for the stock the courts said they should have been able to get.Basically, the rule per Vizcaino is \"Any benefit offered to salaried employees must be offered to temporary ones too unless you deliberately discriminate against them in all your other benefits not related to their job.\"And yes, that&#x27;s a stupid rule. But it&#x27;s the rule, and it&#x27;s universally enforced at every US employer large enough to have a legal department. reply svachalek 14 hours agorootparentThe game is that the contractors are supposedly not working for the company that they&#x27;re actually working for. Anything that might break that illusion puts the company at risk of needing to treat them as the actual employees that they are. reply mistrial9 13 hours agorootparentprevyes, it has everything to do with workplace protection and wages reply hudsonjr 14 hours agorootparentprevI do think the net result of this wad bad.I remember before this decision, I worked somewhere where people could take longer to be promoted as a temp, maybe even 2 years. I don&#x27;t know that this was exploitive, it was usually a mix of developing competency and department having budget. If someone left the company, usually someone got immediately promoted out of being a temp. If not that, it was dependent on department budget increase in the next fiscal year.The legal change meant some roles like QA were put on a company switching treadmill. reply mistrial9 13 hours agorootparentprevno - the reason the issue went to court in the first place, was MSFT and Apple and others, not hiring (stock, health insurance) and then making contractors \"prove themselves\" a.k.a. extra overtime, demeaning social situations, lower perks etc reply paganel 13 hours agoparentprev> And report them if they ever claim to work for Google.Google is already too big at this point, I&#x27;m talking about producing anything that would have a real impact in the medium to long term.In a way, that&#x27;s good, the last thing we really want is for really talented people to be able to do meaningful work at Google&#x27;s scale and given Google&#x27;s current incentives, on the other hand you have to feel for those talented people and for their wasted intellectual potential. reply moritonal 17 hours agoprevIs this a happy story? Having read it my takeaways are that they were immediately asked to rewrite their app in Google&#x27;s way, then a separate research team went off and wrote them a new API for their core functionality. And now given Socratic by Google on the Play Store was last updated on Oct 21, 2020, and is not available for my Android 13 device, so seems to have just died?Kind of seems like Google bought the company, mushed the team into the rest of Google and killed the app off. reply danans 15 hours agoparentCode and infrastructure must evolve, and Google excels at building secure, scalable, performant, maintainable systems that squeeze every last bit of signal from noise. Startups don&#x27;t have the resources to do that, and Google can&#x27;t launch a product built in the startup way.For an example, anything&#x2F;anyone that wants to access user data at Google faces an extremely high bar for access, with layers of access control, auditing, approvals, and enforcement, starting at the design phase through to implementation.At Google that&#x27;s a good thing. However it would be pretty silly at a 10 person startup.What Google isn&#x27;t great at is taking risks on new product ideas (for many good and bad reasons), and that&#x27;s why they often acquire companies that do that sort of thing. reply nitwit005 11 hours agorootparentBuying something, rewriting it, and abandoning it, is just squandering money. You can&#x27;t change that reality by praising Google&#x27;s way of doing things. reply xyzelement 9 hours agorootparent&#x2F;&#x2F; Buying something, rewriting it, and abandoning it, is just squandering money.I don&#x27;t see it that way at all. Everything we do with business carries risk. It&#x27;s really all experimental. Nothing is a sure thing. When you acquire something, you obviously incur the risk of that thing not scaling as well as you think, or over-estimate the fit into your org. You obviously want to make good decisions when you can, but there&#x27;s a limit to how perfect you can be.People are familiar with the VC model of betting on a small percentage of runaway hits. This might be similar.So you can look at each acquisition in isolation and say \"dumb\" but you have to respect the machine that this is a part of. reply josephg 7 hours agorootparent> but you have to respect the machine that this is a part of.I don&#x27;t respect the machine. I think it reduces innovation across our industry.The story of google acquisitions so often go this way. They start with a lot of promises - \"Your product dreams will be so much bigger at Google! All the resources you need! We believe in you!\". When they start at google, everyone eventually realises they need to rebuild their entire product on top of google&#x27;s infrastructure, \"the google way\". Inevitably, the remade google version of the product doesn&#x27;t have \"google scale\" numbers of users. Or its crushed by some other team within google. Or they&#x27;re shoved within a product group who see the newcomers as an irrelevant distraction at best, or a threat to their own product at worst. The good people from the acquired team move on within google and the acquired product dies. It happens so often its become a meme.There have been some notable exceptions: Youtube. Android. Docs (Writely). In each of these cases, google didn&#x27;t have a similar product at the time of the acquisition and the acquired product team was largely left alone afterwards. As I understand it, Youtube and Android are (still?) kept at arms length in some ways from the rest of the company.This is a machine of destruction. It destroys innovative ideas and innovative products. I get that they can&#x27;t all be winners. But google&#x27;s success rate amongst acquisitions surviving - let alone thriving - is ridiculously low. And I don&#x27;t think the teams & products that survive do so because of the strength of their work. I think they survive because of luck and politics.Other companies do this so much better. Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus are very strong products and brands years after being acquired by Facebook. Adobe seems to be taking good care of Figma. And so on.Sometimes I wonder what would happen if google went bankrupt, and all the smart engineers within their walls were suddenly forced onto the street, where they need to make interesting products people actually care about to justify their salaries. I bet there&#x27;s all sorts of great product ideas that googlers dream of building - but never will, because of how cushy and comfortable it is there. Google does some great stuff. But I think their employees are capable of so much more. reply pavel_lishin 10 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s worse than squandering money, it&#x27;s squandering people&#x27;s time, effort, their lives. reply davidcbc 10 hours agorootparentPresumably they got well compensated for their time and effort. That&#x27;s about the best you can expect at a large company. You&#x27;re working on the company&#x27;s products and priorities and getting paid to do so. What they choose to do with it is up to them. reply bitterspeak 10 hours agorootparentprevThe founders know of (or can easily research) Google’s track record with products and they knew the risk going into this acquisition. Probably an unpopular opinion but the time and effort was compensated as part of the acquisition. reply leoh 10 hours agorootparentprevThe counterpoint to this is that individuals can decide if they want their firm to be acquired or not or to stay around after it has been acquired. I don’t mean to put blame or shame on said folks, it requires a lot of careful thinking and self-inquiry and attention to one’s emotions and body to weigh said decisions well; which is hard for many reasons. reply kccqzy 9 hours agorootparentprevPeople can decide that money is more important than the continued survival of the product they are working on. reply rasz 9 hours agorootparentprevRewrite was like a training camp, you learn the company way of doing things on something low stakes. reply danans 10 hours agorootparentprevThe abandoning part is the problem, not the buying and rewriting. reply crdrost 9 hours agorootparentYes but that is a cultural thing. And this is a big theme at Google, and I can say from my limited personal experience working there that it probably stems from the perf process.Look at it this way: Let Π be $PERFCOIN, the currency that is evaluated at performance review time.- Buying the company, got some folks some Π- Rewriting the code, got some (other) folks some Π- Maintaining the code, was not a reliable way to gain Π- Listening to users, interacting with and surveying them, and implementing what they wanted, was not a reliable way to gain Π.I worked on an internal tool at Google so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the huge warnings about accessing user information,[1] yet topic (4), there was just no great way to contact your users, no great way to shadow them as they were using the product, there was a way for them to request features but obviously that would be dominated by 5-10 voices trying to use the product in ways it was never meant to be used...Point (3) I eventually figured out how to do at Google before I left, first off you have to call it “tech debt” and THEN you need to create metrics for your tech debt and THEN you need to set an ambitious goal for “reducing tech debt metrics by 80%” and THAT is worth some Π to some of the managers reviewing your perf.[2]1. Well, I actually did, because I needed a signoff from a privacy team to confirm that our use didn&#x27;t violate Google privacy standards, which the senior members on my team understandably didn&#x27;t even want to do, “can&#x27;t benefit us, can only hurt us if they say we do need to protect Googlers’ privacy from other Googlers”—thankfully the voice of reason mostly prevailed, with a long tail of making sure that we used opaque UUID identifiers to refer to our projects, and not, say, GCP project IDs...2. Worth saying, they transitioned not just to a less frequent less painful perf review process at the end of last year, but it was also a more authoritarian one, Instead of your perf being evaluated by a faceless committee of your manager’s peers, it is now assessed by your manager directly. This is a huge win for transparency and resolving the problem where (3) and (4) don&#x27;t give Π , because pleasing the faceless committee involves standards that are completely unknown to you, but making your manager happy is what people do at any normal job. So this was widely internally criticized, but to my view it&#x27;s actually potentially able to resolve the systemic problem, not immediately, but as culture drifts to be slightly more normal. reply izacus 16 hours agoparentprevI mean... it&#x27;s both?

I mean come on - the upsides: we \"merged cultures\", \"our app lives on\", \"careers have bloomed\" versus downsides \"we quit\", and \"we don&#x27;t think we actually delivered what we wanted to\".

Since the earliest days of the teletype machine, code has been set in monospaced type — letters, on a grid. Monaspace is a new type system that advances the state of the art for the display of code on screen. Every advancement in the technology of computing has been accompanied by advancements to the display and editing of code. CRTs made screen editors possible. The advent of graphical user interfaces gave rise to integrated development environments. Even today, we still have limited options when we want to layer additional meaning on top of code. Syntax highlighting was invented in 1982 to help children to code in BASIC. But beyond colors, most editors must communicate with developers through their interfaces — hovers, underlines, and other graphical decorations. Monaspace offers a more expressive palette for code and the tools we use to work with it.

It’s an unavoidable consequence of trying to fit every letter into a uniform box, when some letters want more space, and some want less. These shortcomings have been the same since the heyday of the Teletype machine in the 1960s. Texture Healing is a novel technique that evens out the density of monospaced type, bringing it closer to how proportional type has looked for centuries. Texture healing preserves the monospace grid, and works in most editors without needing new software or editor plugins. How does it work? calming calming calming calming calming calming In proportional typefaces, every glyph is designed with a unique width. The design of an m can be wider than the design of an i. Every glyph gets the space it needs, and no letter is stuck with too much or too little. The design of each letter incorporates some amount of whitespace on both sides of a glyph. These sidebearings create the visual room that help us distinguish one letterform from the next. Too little, and the letters will run together. Too much, and the letters will look disconnected. But in monospaced faces, every letter must be the same width, regardless of what that letter needs. Adjusting the sidebearings isn’t enough. The letter must be altered to either fill up the box, or squeeze into it — and still leave a little bit of room for sidebearings. Narrow letters like l and i must be designed with exaggerated serifs to better fill the monospace box. Even with these synthetic additions, these narrow letters have more space than they need. Wide letters like m and w are crammed into their boxes, and their shapes are visibly distorted compared to the rest of the alphabet. Their strokes are thinner, and the negative space inside the glyph is also compromised. There’s little room for these glyphs to grow bolder without turning into an unreadable blob. Even though these letters have less space than they want, they still need to leave some room for sidebearings so they don’t crowd the adjacent letters. Shuffle word Texture healing off TIME_limitTIME_limit Texture healing on Texture healing works by finding each pair of adjacent characters where one wants more space, and one has too much. Narrow characters are swapped for ones that cede some of their whitespace, and wider characters are swapped for ones that extend to the very edge of their box. This swapping is powered by an OpenType feature called “contextual alternates,” which is widely supported by both operating systems and browser engines. Contextual alternates are normally used for certain scripts, like Arabic, where the shape of each glyph depends on the surrounding glyphs. And they are also used for cursive handwriting fonts where the stroke of the “pen” might have different connection points across letters. Texture healing is a novel application of this technology to code. See our instructions for enabling texture healing in Visual Studio Code. Step by step Let’s unpack how texture healing is applied. Texture healing off Texture healing on In the word “calming” there are two pairs that can be texture healed. The l has space to give, and the m would benefit from more space. In the first pass, the generic l is replaced with one that is narrower and shifted to the left, away from the m. The generic m can then be replaced by a version that extends to the left edge of the space. Monaspace contains alternates for glyphs that can shrink or grow in either direction. But texture healing can also work in more than one direction. The next pair of characters is also eligible for texture healing. As before, the letter with space to give is replaced with one that cedes some whitespace to its neighbor. This time, it shifts to the right. And now the m is replaced once more, with a variant that extends in both directions. Texture healing finds the most visually compromised pairs and heals them with more legible replacements. The resulting text still obeys the monospaced grid. Styles 640k styles ought to be enough for anyone While the variable fonts support any combination you can choose, every Monaspace font also defines common named weights and styles for applications that do not yet support variable fonts. The three axes are weight, width, and slant. The weight axis ranges from 200 to 800 200: Extra Light 300: Light 400: Regular 500: Medium 600: Semibold 700: Bold 800: ExtraBold The slant axis ranges from 0 to -11° The more negative the value, the more the letters are slanted. At the midpoint of the range some letters change their shapes to become true italics. 0: Normal -5.5°: Swap obliques for italic letterforms -11°: Italic The width axis ranges from 100 to 125. 100: Normal 112.5: Semiwide 125: Wide verbatim verbatim nimblest nimblest foothill foothill metaphor metaphor effusive effusive plummier plummier horology horology Monaspace neon sanguine sanguine platypus platypus cosmical cosmical zoetrope zoetrope mirthful mirthful latticed latticed yodeling yodeling Monaspace argon halflife halflife luminary luminary ornithic ornithic newfound newfound sundries sundries ambulate ambulate clavicor clavicor Monaspace xenon epigrams epigrams panorama panorama chummily chummily humanist humanist wavemark wavemark xenolith xenolith coiffure coiffure Monaspace radon moondust moondust kenotron kenotron bedazzle bedazzle rhomboid rhomboid polymers polymers enigmata enigmata futurist futurist Monaspace krypton Italic Feature Code ligatures Monaspace includes code ligatures for a broad variety of languages, organized into stylistic sets that you can enable or disable according to your preferences. Each stylistic set is roughly designed around the needs of specific languages. For example, ss01 includes ligatures for character sequences commonly seen in JavaScript, and ss05 provides ligatures for operators in F#. You can enable as many or as few of them as you like. In addition to the eight stylistic sets, there are two additional utility sets: calt (contextual alternates) activates ligatures that adjust the visual positioning of some character sequences without altering their shape or appearance. Activating this feature will also enable texture healing. dlig (discretionary ligatures) activates a basic set of ligatures that are shared by many programming languages and frameworks — mostly sequences of repeating characters. Visual Studio Code Choose the stylistic sets you want to enable, and copy the following line into your settings.json: \"editor.fontLigatures\": \"'ss01', 'ss02', 'ss03', 'ss04', 'ss05', 'ss06', 'ss07', 'ss08', 'calt', 'dlig'\", Copy to clipboard ss01 10 == ............................... == === ............................... === =/= ............................... =/= != ............................... != !== ............................... !== /= ............................... /= /== ............................... /== ~~ ............................... ~~ =~ ............................... =~ !~ ............................... !~ ss02 2 >= ............................... >=............................... ->............................... =>............................... -->............................... ~> ~~> ............................... ~~>...............................ss04 5............................... />.............................../\\ ............................... /\\ \\/ ............................... \\/ ss05 2 |> ............................... |>............................... ~> *) ............................... *) */ ............................... */ \\/ ............................... \\/ || ............................... || |> ............................... |> :: ............................... :: := ............................... := :> ............................... :> : ............................... => !~ ............................... !~ != ............................... != !! ............................... !! >: ............................... >: >= ............................... >= -> ............................... ->............................... /> // ............................... // calt 24 // ............................... // /// ............................... /// && ............................... && !! ............................... !! ?? ............................... ?? ?. ............................... ?. ?: ............................... ?: || ............................... || :: ............................... :: ::: ............................... ::: ;; ............................... ;; .. ............................... .. ... ............................... ... =!= ............................... =!= #= ............................... #= := ............................... := =: ............................... =: =:= ............................... =:= :> ............................... :> >: ............................... >: <: ............................... <: :< ............................... :< ..= ............................... ..= ..- ............................... ..- Made with :heart: Contributors Monaspace was made with the goal of improving all code, for all developers. GitHub Next set out on this journey in 2022, and we were fortunate to find a type foundry that shares our passion for improving software in Lettermatic. The result is a marriage of form and function that opens the door to new developer experiences, and that would not have been possible without the domain expertise and skill of the Lettermatic team, and the time they invested to work with GitHub Next on figuring out how typography ought to work for code.

Visit https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commitmono.com&#x2F; and click on the “04 Intelligent” tab for details.In practice this is unusable. Because the width of the letters now depends on the succeeding character, the text jumps as you write it. Super annoying.Cool for reading. Awful for writing. reply CGamesPlay 7 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t in this font? Possibly because of what they talk about where it optimistically gives as much space as possible to succeeding glyphs. You can try it on the page; the code sample boxes are editable. I see no jumping when I type \"calming\", their example word.[append] Oh, I do see some jumping when I type \"optimized\". Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem very jarring to me; the jumping is always right where the edit point is so the added or removed letter causes a much bigger jump. reply sakjur 3 hours agorootparentprevIf this gets popular, I could see a text editor that lets you use a non-healing version of the font for any text that has been written in the viewport and then swaps it out as soon as you no longer looks at that block of text – or straight up uses a different font for my modifications compared to the committed code.But even without anything like that, if it’s good for reading I like to use different fonts when reviewing and writing code to help with the context-switch, so I think this could be useful to me. And I guess people in regions where a single keystroke isn’t always a single character such as Korea, China, Japan and the arab world might be used to the jarring effect already? reply philsnow 52 minutes agorootparent> I could see a text editor that lets you use a non-healing version of the font for any text that has been written in the viewport and then swaps it out as soon as you no longer looks at that block of textThe text editor widget on their page is a bunch of \"line\" divs with individual terms being inside spans.

Why are we as a community so resistant for adopting variable-width fonts? This texture healing already breaks perfect character cell grid, so in some ways it feels like worst of both worlds.I feel at least partially the same about fancy ligatures; we could just use the actual characters in source code, Unicode is widely supported. Raku does that, but it would need better typesetting (with variable-width fonts) to really shine. reply SonOfLilit 2 hours agorootparentI hate ligatures in code.It sometimes breaks out of the grid, but there still is a grid. Things are sometimes not micro-aligned but still macro-aligned, and that matters (to me). reply lionkor 2 hours agorootparentprevthats not what it does - it maintains monoSPACE while chaning the characters to not look the same width -- the best of both worlds, if anything reply omnimus 1 minute agorootparentIts ok but instead of uneven spacing you get uneven character widths.It might be ok but there is a reason why type designers make every character to be the same and try to balance everything including spacing.Monospaced fonts designs are dictated exactly by that limit of fixed character+fixed space.But maybe the “healing” might not be verydistracting. reply chrismorgan 2 hours agorootparentprevIt only breaks the grid visually (and not by much); for layout purposes, which is what you depend on, the grid is still intact.Why do we keep using fixed-width fonts? Because a lot of stuff has been written that depends on a columnar grid. Most notably, terminals are absolutely predicated on it and fundamentally cannot support any other mode of operation.To begin with: visual alignment, ASCII art, diagrams using box-drawing characters, &c., both in code and in the output of diverse tools: def function_name(and_long_parameter_list, so_that_it_wraps=\"like so\"): pass ABC_D = 1 # Explanation ABC_EFG = 2.0 # Another one ABC_HI = 34 # A third one ┌────────┬─────────────┐ │ Tables │ Using │ ┝━━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━┥ │ Cell │ Box-drawing │ │ Cello │ characters │ │ Viola │ ⋮ │ │ Voilà │ │ └────────┴─────────────┘ error: cannot find macro `behold` in this scope --> :1:131fn main() { behold!() }^^^^^^ $ ls -la total 43210 drwxr-xr-x 17 root root 4096 Jan 1 23:45 . drwxr-xr-x 17 root root 4096 Jan 1 23:45 .. lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Feb 29 2020 bin -> usr&#x2F;bin drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Dec 31 23:59 boot ⋮(I included the ⋮ in the box drawing table deliberately, because it demonstrates a weakness in the scheme: terminals and most monospacy text editors force stuff into the grid, just clipping or overflowing the cell if a glyph has to come from a fallback font, but most other things don’t, so you end up with visual alignment breaking if the fallback font used has different metrics. Also the whole East Asian Width thing and ucwidth and whatever is super messy. Your monospace font may or may not include the box-drawing characters, but it’s much more unlikely to include ⋮.)Terminals are also built on columnar behaviour; there are escape codes for moving the cursor to such-and-such a line and column, for example, and things like a side-by-side split require columnar behaviour.Text editors can go non-monospaced, but it breaks various content for the reasons discussed, and you’ll need monospace for any terminal because loads of stuff will break otherwise, so combined with inertia, even editors that support proportional fonts aren’t often used that way if they default to monospace.(Me, I’d rather like to use a proportional font while editing, but I’m not moving off Vim for it, so I’ll probably never get it. But for presentation, I like to go at least partially proportional with the monospace font Triplicate’s Poly variant, which breaks strict monospaceness, widening characters like w&#x2F;m&#x2F;W&#x2F;M and narrowing characters like i&#x2F;j&#x2F;l&#x2F;1. As for what Monaspace’s texture healing, I like it most of the time, but am not sold on cases like some_function_w_, where the last two underscores are markedly shorter than the first and it feels unbalanced.) reply idan 12 hours agoparentprevIt really is super clever!

(This includes almost all Windows for now, I believe; and some Linux, probably no longer most since GNOME is bent on ruining everyone’s life; and some macOS.)—⁂—When is `overflow: scroll` legitimate?One obsolete case is preventing document scrolling when a modal is open, without triggering reflow due to the scrollbar disappearing, but I say the side-effects are still worse than the problem (the document scrollbar is nonsensical while the modal is open), so you should let it be (why was scrolling the document under the modal such a problem anyway?), or prevent scrolling by means other than scrollbar manipulation, by capturing it in the modal backdrop.Another obsolete case is avoiding a bit of layout shift when switching between pages if some fit in the viewport an others don’t; but honestly it’s so long since I’ve seen a site where any pages fit in the viewport… and more to the point, this is better handled with `scrollbar-gutter` (not supported by Safari; you could use @supports to fall back to `overflow: scroll`, but the importance and number of affected users—since Safari is normally overlay scrollbars—are so tiny I don’t think it’s worth it).The only arguably legitimate case I can think of is on spreadsheets&#x2F;data grid components, where you can reasonably prefer to display a noop scrollbars rather than just reserving the space for them.OK, and one other: code to find scrollbar dimensions for various layout purpose normally uses `overflow: scroll` on a temporary element and this is legit, even though you could do it other, mildly more complex ways; but it also makes assumptions about scrollbars always being the same size, and there’s honestly no reason why they should be, and `scrollbar-width` has shown a distinct appetite for using thinner scrollbars in some places and a browser could reasonably vary its default scrollbar width based on the dimensions. And scrollbar-dimension-finding isn’t particularly common, and the problems it’s used to solve are mostly better handled in other ways; now if only viewport units weren’t broken by design in the presence of document scrollbars…I’ve contemplated campaigning for explicit deprecation of `overflow: scroll` and getting warnings shown in dev tools if you use them, because I’ve seen it misused so many times in the last decade, where people actually meant `overflow: auto`, and other than scrollbar-dimension-finding doubt I’ve seen even a single legitimate and reasonable use in that time. reply omneity 8 hours agoprevTexture healing is that kind of feature you never knew you needed until you knew about it.

Some Insurers Still Won’t Tell You. Federal regulations require insurers to promptly hand over records to patients facing claim denials. Some insurers only turned over their files after ProPublica reached out. by Maya Miller, with additional reporting by Ash Ngu Nov. 8, 7:05 a.m. EST Twitter Facebook Copy Link Copied! Change Appearance Auto Light Dark Republish Series: Uncovered: How the Insurance Industry Denies Coverage to Patients Health insurers reject millions of claims for treatment every year in America. Corporate insiders, recordings and internal emails expose the system and its harm. If you want to request your own claim file, head to our “Claim File Helper.” If you have trouble getting your claim file back, let us know what happened at claimfile@propublica.org. ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. Just outside public view, the American health insurance industry’s algorithms, employees and executives process tens of millions of claims for people seeking medical care. Sometimes, as ProPublica has reported, insurers base decisions on what’s good for the company’s bottom line rather than what’s good for the patient’s health. Sometimes, insurers make mistakes. In one case we learned about, a company denied a child’s treatment because it based its judgment on adult guidelines instead of pediatric ones. In another, an internal reviewer misread what type of surgery the patient sought and denied coverage based on that error. Read More Use our free tool to generate a letter requesting your claim file. Find Out Why Your Health Insurer Denied Your Claim At first, these patients had no idea why they were denied treatment. But in each instance, insurance employees left a paper trail — in notes, emails or recordings of phone calls — explaining what happened. Patients and advocates used what they found in those records to craft appeals and ultimately receive the care they needed. Federal law and regulations require insurers to hand over exactly this sort of information in response to a written request. And they have to do it fast: Most people who get insurance through an employer should get the records, called claim files, within 30 days. There’s just one catch: Some insurers aren’t turning files over like they’re supposed to. We followed ProPublica readers through the process with five different insurers. Several companies only shared documents with patients after we reached out. Our team discovered how useful claim files can be after a patient shared internal notes and calculations that a health insurer had made about his case. But few health insurers advertise this service or offer clear instructions for getting these records. To help fill that gap, we published a guide explaining how to submit a claim file request. We also shared resources with health care providers and patient advocates nationwide, including request letter templates. Get Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.

Donate More than 120 people have told us that they have since requested or intend to request their claim files. Though a handful say they received information that helped them understand why their health insurer denied coverage, many more have been running into challenges. They’ve told us about insurers blowing past deadlines, wrongly requiring subpoenas and — in several cases — misinterpreting their request entirely. We shared a summary of these examples with Tim Hauser, a deputy assistant secretary with the Department of Labor. His office oversees claim file laws that cover more than 131 million people. He said insurers who fail to provide records are breaking the law. “The claimant really needs to be able to see what the relevant evidence is so that they can respond to it,” he said. We brought our findings to five insurance companies. We presented them with details about the requests patients had made and how the company had responded, and we asked for an explanation of what happened in each case. All of the insurers acknowledged that the patients were entitled to the material they’d asked for. Four began sending the files after our inquiry. Two, spokespeople told us, are updating policies to handle future requests. Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesperson Michael Bowman said the company needed to better train staff on the rules “to close any gaps to prevent this from occurring in the future.” Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions admitted that patients do not need a subpoena to access their records, contrary to what the insurer had told a member. She said the company would update its “policies and communications to reflect that for future requests. We regret that we did not make these updates sooner and apologize for any frustration or confusion this has caused our customers.” By crowdsourcing people’s experiences, we identified some patterns in health insurers’ behavior. Here are some of the most common issues people encountered — and what to watch out for if you submit your own request: Insurers Asking for Unnecessary Subpoenas or Court Orders Cigna and Anthem told members that they would need to obtain a court order or subpoena to access their claim file records. “This is completely unheard of,” said Wells Wilkinson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit legal group Public Health Advocates who regularly files these requests. “It also sounds completely illegal. The consumer has the right to any information used by the health plan in the context of the denial.” On July 12, Lisa Kays, a Maryland resident, asked Cigna for phone call records related to its decision to deny coverage for her 4-year-old son’s speech therapy. “We couldn’t afford to just give up,” Kays said. In September, Cigna sent her a letter saying she would need to submit a subpoena to get any transcripts or recordings. After ProPublica inquired, the company sent Kays partial transcripts of the calls. It also reimbursed her for some of the previously denied coverage. She is still waiting for the recordings. We asked Anthem about a similar case. On July 19, a call center agent told Pamela Tsigdinos she would need a subpoena to receive her claim file records. Tsigdinos had submitted the request 50 days earlier. Bowman, the Anthem spokesperson, told us the response was an error and apologized. The company compiled the claim file and sent it to Tsigdinos. Insurers Confusing Claim File Requests With Appeals At least five people told ProPublica that, after submitting a request for a claim file, their health insurer mistook the request for an appeal. We brought three cases to UnitedHealthcare. S.J. Farris requested her claim file from the company on May 10. Five days later, she received a response stating that her request for an appeal had been received. Farris sent a clarifying letter but was met with a call from an appeals agent based in Ireland. “I asked her to send the claim files,” Farris said. “She had no idea what I was talking about.” After ProPublica sent the company questions, Farris received a call from UnitedHealth in October. They told her that the insurer was working on her claim file and that she should expect it soon. In a statement to ProPublica, UnitedHealth spokesperson Maria Gordon Shydlo said: “We take our responsibility to provide members access to their records seriously and have processes in place to comply with the law. We are sorry for any inconvenience.” After Beth Tolley sent Anthem a claim file request on behalf of her granddaughter, she received a letter from the health insurer stating, “We’ve received a request from Beth Tolley for an appeal.” This left Tolley confused since, in its last communication, Anthem had said all avenues of appeal with its office had been exhausted. In early October, Anthem sent the Tolley family a check for the amount it had initially declined to cover. Bowman told ProPublica that the company would be sending the records soon. Insurers Blowing Past the 30-Day Deadline For most people who get insurance through their employers, insurers are required to send claim files back within 30 days, according to federal law. Twelve of the people whose requests ProPublica followed did not receive their records within that time frame even though they had these types of plans. Five of those had been waiting for responses from their insurers for more than 70 days before ProPublica contacted the companies with questions. Isabella Gonzalez submitted a claim file request via certified mail on Aug. 8. When she called Aetna to get an update, a representative told her they did not see it in the system and advised her to upload it onto the insurer’s online portal, which she did. She called back a few days later. A different customer service employee told her Aetna would respond in 45 days. Alex Kepnes, the executive director of communications for Aetna, said the company at first did not recognize what Gonzalez was asking for and therefore did not respond to it. Kepnes declined to respond to follow-up questions about why staff failed to correctly identify the request and whether the company would be taking action to ensure this does not happen again. Other companies that failed to follow the 30-day timeline include UnitedHealth, Anthem and Cigna. “It’s really important that these responses be timely,” said Hauser, the Department of Labor official. “If that’s not happening, it’s really contrary to the regulation.” If you are facing a health insurance denial and want to get your claim file, check out ProPublica’s “Claim File Helper.” If your health insurer blocks your access to a claim file, you can contact the agency that regulates your health insurance company.

So even if you know the grounds for denial, sometimes the reason is bullshit and flies in the face of the insurer&#x27;s own policies.I spent months fighting a claim for mesalamine DR tablets (and getting nowhere) only to discover that the insurance personnel were treating it as a different claim for mesalamine EC capsules—a totally distinct formulation. Any doctor or pharmacist could tell you that they&#x27;re not equivalent. But they had different approval criteria in the insurance system, and even though I met the criteria for the former (the drug I wanted) they kept denying me for not meeting the criteria of the latter (the drug I did not want).But those are both oral forms. I think if they&#x27;d tried to run the claim as the suppository version, the error would&#x27;ve been more obvious. reply ceejayoz 16 hours agoparentEven when they are a doctor, it doesn&#x27;t matter. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;cigna-pxdx-medical-health...> Over a period of two months last year, Cigna doctors denied over 300,000 requests for payments using this method, spending an average of 1.2 seconds on each case, the documents show. reply rqtwteye 14 hours agorootparentHow are these guys allowed to stay in business? Hospitals and insurances make many \"mistakes\" in their favor and leave it up to the patient to navigate this kafkaeske bureaucracy. I understand making some honest mistakes but this stuff is just plain fraud. reply anigbrowl 10 hours agorootparentFraud is an American norm, that&#x27;s why lobbyists make big bucks. One of the US Senators for Florida was CEO of a company that was convicted of 14 counts of defrauding Medicare and had to pay $1.7 billion in fines, but he just said he knew nothing about it and went on to become Governor and later Senator for his state.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rick_ScottMeanwhile a Democratic Senator from New Jersey is credibly accused of taking bribes from Egypt (evidence included literal bars of gold discovered in his home pursuant to a search warrant), but he refuses to resign.Corruption is endemic in the US, it just has good lawyers and PR people. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentSetting US standards by the citizens of Florida and New Jersey is a bit outside the bell curve... reply anigbrowl 6 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m quite sure I could find examples from every state, I just picked the two most egregious examples that sprang to mind. reply kurthr 14 hours agorootparentprevThe combination of paying of pocket or face horrific medical consequences along with ERISA limiting legal claims makes it unlikely the insurance companies face any consequences to their actions.Unless you&#x27;re a wealthy litigation attorney who has friends that will rack up enormous bills as insurance takes it to federal appeals court.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;blue-cross-proton-therapy... reply scythe 13 hours agorootparentOne thing that&#x27;s especially egregious about the situation in RadOnc is that there are plenty of situations where the doctors and physicists have already planned a treatment, billing $xxx per hour, and only then it is denied by insurance, so the hospital counts this as a loss and plans another inferior treatment, increasing the cost, in order to offer a \"cheaper\" procedure as demanded by the insurance company. The losses are of course amortized to drive up the cost of all treatments while the patients are given inferior care.It&#x27;s absolutely infuriating. A friend who is a therapy physicist left the country and went back to work in Canada taking a 40% pay cut because he couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentprev>> ...spending an average of 1.2 seconds on each case...> How are these guys allowed to stay in business?Afaik, that&#x27;s exactly how the ACA was written -- there&#x27;s a ceiling to non-care expenses that insurance companies can include in premiums.One consequence of this is pushing insurers to be hyper-efficient. One consequence of that is the average case needing to take 1.2 seconds.Granted, that likely includes a huge amount of happy path cases that flow through automated rules engines, which effectively take no time.So really, it&#x27;s more like (most cases take 0 time) + (a low number of cases take non-zero time) = 1.2 seconds on average. reply jrockway 4 hours agorootparentprevI think the best analogy I can come up with is your kid touching a hot stove. You tell them not to, but they do anyway, and then when they learn that it really hurts, they stop doing it. Regulations are like that. Regulations are a SUPER hot stove. The employees at the insurance company want to touch the stove as often as possible. They get paid extra the closer they come to touching it. But, as more companies get burned by the stove for failing to meet the regulation&#x27;s requirements, they learn that being in pain is bad. Then, they stop trying to touch the stove.So this ProPublica article is great; they say to someone relatively important at the insurance company, \"hey, the individuals you wronged are actually well-connected enough to get journalists involved\" and the companies get REALLY SCARED, because step 2 after the newspaper article is published is every junior US Attorney in the country tripping over each other to cart them off to prison as quickly as possible. (OK, it&#x27;s probably a fine. But shareholders do not like your stock when you are routinely fined, and CEOs are paid in stock. See why competent people might get involved when that&#x27;s at risk?)You can read this article as \"evil companies are evil\", but I read it as \"evil companies are learning\". There will be eventually a day when your entire claims packet is on the same website as your EOBs, and you can click a link to report a mistake. The companies will have to act on your reported mistakes, because a paper trail that says they did something illegal is super bad for the shareholders. It takes time, but journalism like this is what gets it started. If you feel depressed, don&#x27;t. The system is slow, but the system is working. This is what we have democracy and a free press for! reply andrewjl 8 hours agorootparentprevI always felt that every insurance company should report anonymized aggregate percentages for denied claims in some fashion. Not sure how much that would help but it could shine more light on the issue. reply rqtwteye 4 hours agorootparentAn interesting number would be the number of successful appeals after denial. If that number is high it would indicate that they are denying too often. reply yborg 15 hours agorootparentprevIn many cases these doctors aren&#x27;t practicing physicians, iirc the reviewer in the article hadn&#x27;t practiced for 25 years. They just need someone with an MD to sign off on the denials. reply carbocation 14 hours agorootparentMy view is that these people and companies are practicing medicine and should start being held to the standard of care. reply MichaelZuo 11 hours agorootparentSince you have some experience in the field, How do you see your views becoming reality? reply carbocation 9 hours agorootparentSadly the practicing side and the regulatory side are different enough that I basically don&#x27;t have much insight into why my views are wrong. (I mean, presumably if my views were right, some enterprising lawyer would have applied the theory already.) E.g., if there is legislation that is acting as a barrier, we could get our representatives to change it. If these folks remain boarded and are practicing outside of the norms and scope, then we could get our medical licensing boards to take action as well. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentAfaik, medical review professionals are acting more as expert witnesses (with a crushing case load). reply DangitBobby 4 hours agorootparentThey get privileged access to your medical information and directly impact the treatment plan you get. They are practicing medicine. replyspondylosaurus 15 hours agorootparentprev1.2 seconds! Well they&#x27;re sure putting that med school knowledge to use, huh. reply ceejayoz 15 hours agorootparentYep. Don&#x27;t worry, though; if they slip up and do fund your expensive treatments, all of a sudden they have lots of time to focus on you.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;unitedhealth-healthcare-i...> At one point, court records show, United inaccurately reported to Penn State and the family that McNaughton’s doctor had agreed to lower the doses of his medication. Another time, a doctor paid by United concluded that denying payments for McNaughton’s treatment could put his health at risk, but the company buried his report and did not consider its findings. The insurer did, however, consider a report submitted by a company doctor who rubber-stamped the recommendation of a United nurse to reject paying for the treatment.> But the records reviewed by ProPublica show that United had another, equally urgent goal in dealing with McNaughton. In emails, officials calculated what McNaughton was costing them to keep his crippling disease at bay and how much they would save if they forced him to undergo a cheaper treatment that had already failed him. As the family pressed the company to back down, first through Penn State and then through a lawsuit, the United officials handling the case bristled. reply NickC25 15 hours agorootparentHorrifying. Those \"insurers\" are absolute scumbags. Poor guy, I feel awful for him. reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agorootparent> Those \"insurers\" are absolute scumbagsIt’s complicated. On the other hand are fraudsters and private-equity owned hospitals maxing the bill button. If the insurer is lax with payouts, it depletes its capital and could be left insolvent. It’s a scummy system more than a system of scumbags. (To be clear, there are scumbag insurers. But it’s reductive to cite that generally, or designate it as the source of the system’s troubles.) reply justinclift 14 hours agorootparentTaking 1.2 seconds to review claims means they are without any question \"doing something wrong\".\"Remaining solvent\" doesn&#x27;t seem to be the goal, rather \"maximising quarterly bonuses regardless of lives destroyed\" seems a more fit description. reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agorootparent> Taking 1.2 seconds to review claims means they are without any question \"doing something wrong\"Nobody said they aren’t. The point is, given the volume of claims, to do a proper analysis, we’d need a material fraction of doctors doing insurance reviews (instead of seeing patients). So we get a reliance on heuristics.If you’re lenient, you get targeted by fraudsters. So we get a bias towards denial. (Nobody is getting a material quarterly bonus for denying a few more claims. That nonsense occurs at the level of PBMs and other scale operations.) reply iamjackg 13 hours agorootparentIf a business can&#x27;t handle its own scale without negatively affecting its customers, it should probably stop growing. It&#x27;s the same issue we see with Google accounts being seemingly randomly terminated.Since that probably won&#x27;t happen, heuristic usage should at least come with penalties attached, otherwise the incentives are lopsided. If an airline&#x27;s overbooking heuristics fail and get you bumped, you either get put on another flight and&#x2F;or receive financial compensation. If an insurance company&#x27;s \"heuristics\" fail and deny a legitimate claim, there should be a penalty. If Google terminates your account because of a mistake, they should pay a fine. They shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have their cake and eat it too. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparent> If a business can&#x27;t handle its own scale without negatively affecting its customersThe scale probably helps. The point is if every billable decision is medically reviewed for more than a few seconds, a material fraction of the healthcare workforce needs to be diverted from patients to review.There is simply no solution, given the current industrial structure, to avoid some combination of non-expert, high-speed review without making even stupider trade-offs. reply NoraCodes 12 hours agorootparentSounds like we need to replace the structure, given that it&#x27;s not fit for purpose. reply JumpCrisscross 11 hours agorootparent> Sounds like we need to replace the structure, given that it&#x27;s not fit for purposeWe soundly agree.

And the government is the one deciding to pay.If anything, that would mean more claims should be denied.Looking at the study, it seems like the government made some erroneous assumptions about who would be taking advantage of the policies the government created, resulting in the extra costs.

And executives at UnitedHealth Group, the country’s largest insurer, told their workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses — and when they couldn’t find enough, sent them back to try again.> Each of the strategies — which were described by the Justice Department in lawsuits against the companies — led to diagnoses of serious diseases that might have never existed. But the diagnoses had a lucrative side effect: They let the insurers collect more money from the federal government’s Medicare Advantage program.> Eight of the 10 biggest Medicare Advantage insurers — representing more than two-thirds of the market — have submitted inflated bills, according to the federal audits. And four of the five largest players — UnitedHealth, Humana, Elevance and Kaiser — have faced federal lawsuits alleging that efforts to overdiagnose their customers crossed the line into fraud. reply lotsofpulp 11 hours agorootparentThat is just clear fraud, and I don’t understand how that is a lawsuit instead of felony charges for everyone involved. replyjustinclift 13 hours agorootparentprev> If you’re lenient, you get targeted by fraudsters.So in this scenario, it sounds like the fraudsters are the medical insurance companies, and the group being lenient are the regulators.A place taking (on average) 1.2 seconds to review each claim shouldn&#x27;t be in business. reply trogdor 7 hours agorootparentprevThat is not necessarily true.As another commenter pointed out, average review time is likely a misleading figure, since the overwhelming majority of decisions are made automatically, using predetermined rules engines.So nearly all decisions take zero seconds, and a small minority take much longer, leading to an average of 1.2 seconds, when in reality, those claims that are reviewed manually take far more than 1.2 seconds to review.As the other commenter put it: “(most cases take 0 time) + (a low number of cases take non-zero time) = 1.2 seconds on average.” reply cycomanic 13 hours agorootparentprevUnited healthcare in 2022 had $324 billion revenue (up from $75 billion in 2007) and profits of $20 billion (both up >15% year on year).

A health care company collects money under the premise that \"these premiums you&#x27;re paying will cover you if something bad happens\". If that something bad does happen (and for most people, it never will), that money should be available to pay for whatever happened. The insurer, now concerned about their margins and profits more than providing you the service that you&#x27;ve already paid them to do, just gets to trot out some poorly paid rep with no medical knowledge to override the medical advice of a trained medical professional. Now, you&#x27;re not only injured, you&#x27;re paying out of pocket for a service that won&#x27;t actually do what you&#x27;ve paid it to do. The only winner here is the insurer&#x27;s C-Suite and stockholders who get to brag on quarterly earnings calls that they&#x27;ve denied tens of thousands of claims (and they even get fiscally rewarded for it!).In a more modern and honest society we would call for-profit insurers what they actually are: a racketeering organization operating under the guise of fraud. reply JohnFen 15 hours agorootparent> A health care company collects money under the premise that \"these premiums you&#x27;re paying will cover you if something bad happens\"That&#x27;s not the premise of insurance, though. The premise of insurance is that a large group of people pools their money (through paying premiums), out of which the people in need of assistance get paid. It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;ll be \"repaid\" your premiums in services. It&#x27;s pooled risk, not a kind of savings or investment.In order for it to work financially, most people have to never have claims in excess of what they paid in.

The whole point is to be able to cover exceptional and rare disasters.This is where the problem is. Humans will have health problems and will have claims, especially after age 50. Which means (assuming a stable population), the present value of premiums has to equal the present value of all the healthcare you will need (until you get to Medicare, age 65). Which is a large number, especially considering the obesity&#x2F;hypertension&#x2F;diabetes&#x2F;heart disease rates.Which means premiums are effectively just another tax (except they are no longer mandated). A big wrinkle here is declining proportion of younger populations to pay for older populations, so the premiums young people pay for healthcare older people receive now, but when the young people are older, there will be fewer younger people to pay for them, so it is also a marginal “age” tax, where the younger people pay for more than what they will receive. Exactly the same as Medicare taxes. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t solved by high deductible health plans, because they just kick the can down the road by letting customers self-segregate into different risk profiles.- Young with no health issues?

I&#x27;m not an economist, but every definition of \"market\" I can find says something like \"a system where two parties can engage in a transaction\". If there&#x27;s a significant chance that one of the parties is unconscious and&#x2F;or about to die, they are not engaging in a transaction any more than a mugging victim is. 5% is the chance of rolling a 1 on a d20, that is certainly significant. reply MichaelZuo 11 hours agorootparentCan you link one such definition? reply burkaman 8 hours agorootparent> In economics, a market is a composition of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations or infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange.- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Market_(economics)> A market is a place where parties can gather to facilitate the exchange of goods and services.- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;m&#x2F;market.asp reply lotsofpulp 14 hours agorootparentprevThat is a good point, but unless people work for free, someone is selling and someone is buying.

Obviously firefighters purchase equipment and sell their labor to the government, but we don&#x27;t refer to homeowners as buyers in a firefighting market. If we forced them to pay a fee after being saved from a fire, that wouldn&#x27;t somehow constitute a market.

You still have to pay it though.The fact that rich people sometimes choose to accept a parking ticket or choose to purchase citizenship in a more favorable tax environment is not evidence of a market, in fact it&#x27;s the opposite.

The remaining fully insured market is relatively small.Health insurers have low profit margins. You can read their audited financial statements for the publicly traded ones. Some are even non-profit. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) set a minimum 85% medical loss ratio. The insurers have to cover their operating costs and profit margins out of the remaining 15%.

But in practice an insurance denial does sometimes leave low income patients without access to care.Ultimately though there does have to be some system for rationing care. Demand is effectively infinite and resources are finite. Even countries with single payer or socialized medicine restrict which treatments they make available, and often restrict patient access to expensive treatments by imposing queues.I didn&#x27;t claim that the current system is a good one.

Everyone wants insurance that covers every single claim with few questions or limits, but that insurance company would quickly have to make the choice between dramatically increasing premiums or going out of business.Every time a government entity mandates that insurance plans cover additional services, the cost of care goes up and subsequently so do premiums. When premiums go up, people &#x2F; businesses shart shopping around and leave the pool, meaning the risk is spread out among even fewer (likely sicker) people and the premiums go up even more.The alternative is just having everyone in one giant \"single payer\" pool so risk is minimized, with participation mandatory. Then, that entity (government probably) would just pay all the claims because in theory there would be less incentive to watch the bottom line. In reality, we&#x27;ve already tried this: Medicare is the largest single-payer health insurance system in the world, plus we have 50 Medicaid single-payer systems at the state level and additional single-payer systems at the federal level (Tri-Care and VA benefits). All of these systems face the same fiscal challenges and have been implementing every cost control measure they can think of for the past 2 decades. Medicare has been trying to move from Fee For Service (FFS) to outcome-based reimbursement for a long time now.Those of us who know, know: the problem is COST in the system. Healthcare is EXPENSIVE. reply warner25 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that government-run health insurance (i.e. Medicare, Medicaids, Tricare) == \"single-payer\" healthcare system, especially in terms of the effects described by the parent comment.My perspective is being under Tricare. You can imagine it like a closed system in which Tricare beneficiaries just go to Military Treatment Facilities (Defense Health Agency and service-run hospitals and clinics) for everything, and everything done in those facilities is covered with no questions asked and no bills or money changing hands. But that isn&#x27;t how it works in practice. A large amount of stuff, like most specialty care, gets referred to places \"out in town\" (at local, for-profit, civilian providers). Most ER and urgent care visits happen out in town. At times, my wife and kids have been on Tricare Select which works like a PPO and involves all the usual discussions about who does or doesn&#x27;t take Tricare, in-network or out-of-network, whether something needs pre-authorization or not, why a claim has been denied and how to appeal it, whether we&#x27;ve reached our annual deductible or catastrophic cap, etc.So under Tricare, I think I feel more protected from profit-driven shenanigans and expensive mistakes than most Americans, but there&#x27;s still a \"cognitive workload, stress and uncertainty.\" I think a true single-payer system means that you don&#x27;t have this (because it works like the closed system described above). reply Aurornis 14 hours agoparentprevI worked with some coworkers who emigrated to the USA a few years back. They all shared similar fears about the US Healthcare system. Once we showed them how it worked, how to use our insurance company&#x27;s website, and how to confirm that services were authorized they had no real problems.HN, Reddit, and the rest of the internet have become really good at sharing horror stories, but increasingly many of those horror stories are either misleading or based on old laws that no longer apply. A popular trick on Reddit is for people to post the part of their bill that goes from their provider to the insurance company and say \"This is how much it costs to have a baby in the United States!\". However, nobody actually pays the amount that gets billed to the insurance company. They pay an amount determined by their insurance deductible, co-pay, and out of pocket maximum. Once you go past the out of pocket maximum for a year, everything is covered 100% in network.We even recently had new laws against surprise billing, which plugs many of the holes that created those horror stories about going into a hospital and discovering you were out of network after the fact. Technically there are still holes where this can happen, but if you look carefully most of the horror stories online are from many years ago.Is the system perfect? Of course not. However, in practice people aren&#x27;t going bankrupt every time they go to the doctor like you&#x27;d think from Reddit posts. When it comes to pre-authorizations, these tend to get negotiated between your doctor&#x27;s office and the insurance company. Doctors offices know how to push pre-authorizations through if they want to put in the effort, but many some will shrug it off because it&#x27;s not billable time for them. reply dale_glass 10 hours agorootparentThanks, but more money isn&#x27;t worth the stress of dealing with that bullshit. I&#x27;m not moving one inch from Europe.Especially, I have no interest whatsoever in having my health insurance tied to my job.> They pay an amount determined by their insurance deductible, co-pay, and out of pocket maximum.

It feels like the system is we tie everyone down to train tracks, then we hire someone to semaphore to the conductor to pull the brakes just in time. Most of the time, for people who can afford a good signaler, the locomotive stops a few inches before it turns them into strawberry jelly, so no-harm no-foul, the system works?The signaler, conductor and roper all work for different faceless corporations constantly trying to screw each other and&#x2F;or you though, the semaphore language is so complicated no human being can speak it, and the message in it can&#x27;t be known until the locomotive is a few hundred feet away though. You can only choose 1 of 2 options for every role too, so everyone involved is terrible.Sure we closed some of the loopholes where the locomotive could start again after braking, or the signaler could refuse to do their job because the brakes were offbrand. Really though what I&#x27;d like is to just not be in mortal peril at all, which is not the same thing as barely avoiding getting liquified by a steel behemoth by a complex confluence of forces beyond my control. reply warner25 11 hours agorootparentprev> However, nobody actually pays the amount that gets billed to the insurance company...While mostly true, the system always strikes me as insane when I see the amounts billed to my insurer alongside the amounts \"allowed\" or paid by my insurer (or paid by me until we hit the deductible). I&#x27;m talking about the negotiated rates, I guess, not even co-pays. I regularly see things like $8,889 billed and $149 \"allowed.\" reply hotpotamus 9 hours agorootparentprevWhat about the 5 million people in my state who don’t have health insurance? Should they be worried about their medical needs? reply dboreham 14 hours agoparentprevIf you study the history of how the system came to be, it turns out to be a combination of: Drs like money, and (like most things in the US) racism. reply gnopgnip 13 hours agoparentprevThe reality for people with a well paid white collar job or a union or that work for the government or a non profit or in healthcare is that everything is fine. The employer pays for 100% of the premium. With insurance like Kaiser you pay your copay and that is all. Everyone at Kaiser in network, most directly employed, no surprise billing. Pre auths are easy when everything is in network. Your out of pocket max is as low as $2k. reply linuxftw 15 hours agoparentprevThankfully, the ACA made insurance mandatory for everyone. Not only do we have a garbage system, we&#x27;re obliged to participate in it. reply vkou 15 hours agorootparent1.

The individual mandate was struck down.In my opinion, this was a brilliant strategic move by those opposed because it guarantees the eventual financial inviability of all of the ACA. Decreasing the size of the risk pool by allowing people to opt out will guarantee that it won&#x27;t work long-term. reply power 14 hours agoprev [–] A lesson learned from hard experience and unfortunately too late: get your own illness benefit insurance.

    "originBody": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak suffers minor stroke Published 11 hours ago Share IMAGE SOURCE, EPA-EFE/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is on his way home after suffering a minor stroke, according to US media reports. Mr Wozniak told ABC News a MRI scan confirmed he had a stroke whilst attending the World Business Forum in Mexico City. The 73-year-old was taken to hospital after passing out at the conference, according to the CNN news website. The BBC has contacted representatives of Mr Wozniak for comment. Better known in the tech world as Woz, Mr Wozniak is a Silicon Valley veteran who co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976 and invented the first Apple computer. Apple went on to become the most valuable company in the world. The computing pioneer signed a letter in March alongside Elon Musk calling for a pause in the development of the most powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models. AI could make scams harder to spot - Wozniak He called for the regulation of AI when he spoke to the BBC in May 2023, fearing the technology would be harnessed by \"bad actors\". He said: \"AI is so intelligent it's open to the bad players, the ones that want to trick you about who they are.\" But he sounded a note of scepticism that regulators would get it right: \"I think the forces that drive for money usually win out, which is sort of sad.\" Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.

At a conference he keynoted for (SynBioBeta), he said that even if immortality were available to him, he wouldn&#x27;t want to live forever, because he&#x27;d be taking up a spot in the Earth&#x27;s population carrying capacity, and even if that&#x27;s just one spot of many billions, he wouldn&#x27;t feel right taking up that spot, when he&#x27;s already lived his life and now it&#x27;s time for someone new to get the chance to enjoy the adventure that is living. reply kome 2 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s surprising to me that such an obviously common-sense viewpoint is being treated as if it&#x27;s extraordinary. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s commendable that he hasn&#x27;t succumbed to the delusions of grandeur and immortality. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentWhat&#x27;s so common-sense about it?

Immortality being a curse is a common trope. Hell, even surviving to 90 or 100 can be its own kind of hell for those whose life is being unnaturally preserved for the sake of those who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t let go. reply scotty79 10 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s a trope because it&#x27;s silly. Like another trope of being rich being a curse. Usually the trope includes some big tradeoffs for immortality and underestimates brain capacity to forget nearly everything and make up half of the stuff you \"rememeber\". reply upwardbound 1 hour agorootparentprevI think Woz&#x27;s point is that no matter how much the carrying capacity of the Earth (or even the entire solar system, or galaxy) is increased, it will always be finite. It&#x27;s possible that we might be lucky enough to live through a great era of spaceward expansion during which even our best efforts at population growth are slower than the than the even faster growth of population capacity, and that would be amazing. That&#x27;s the type of historical era in which a slogan of \"be fruitful and multiply\" is really good advice. But unless the universe has infinite future potential -- specifically, a way to access a limitless source of negentropy (either through time travel or magitech or something equally reality-warping) -- then eventually the population capacity would stop growing. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentExtended to the limit, it&#x27;s a fair point, but this type of thinking is arguably far from common-sense (since it&#x27;s uncommon for people to engage in universe-scale hypotheticals), and arguably a problem for the future - i.e. for when we start outgrowing the galaxy or something. reply anonymouskimmer 46 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a problem for the future, it&#x27;s where we are at now until sufficiently advanced technology (or sufficiently peaceful international relations) intervenes. reply mschuster91 31 minutes agorootparentprev> Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity is a problem to be solvedIt&#x27;s not getting solved though, it&#x27;s getting worse day by day because of climate change making increasingly large amounts of space uninhabitable, soil erosion, the aftereffects of pollution with all kinds of crap (PFAS, microplastics, nitrates from fertilizer runoff, ...) and over-exploitation below replacement levels (e.g. in fish).> there are many viable solutions that can be executed in parallel, and it doesn&#x27;t really sound like a big challenge relative to getting life extension working in the first place.We barely understand how our body works in detail. We know a bit on how to do genetic manipulation, but at the moment no one seriously works on manipulating germ cells out of ethical reason - even something as \"simple\" as cloning a human is widely seen as unethical, and completely forget about using something like CRISPR to manipulate the genetics of a live human outside of people for whom this is the only chance at getting a few years out of some fatal disease.> Really, it&#x27;s just bewildering to me that having a death wish is considered common-sense, normal viewpoint.Memento mori. reply worklaptopacct 1 hour agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s universally a common sense standpoint with regard to everyone. Some people have a purpose to provide to their family and leave a legacy; this is a goal that can be fulfilled.

My Woz story is from junior high school (middle school) in the late 1990s. I was writing a report on him and read two different biographies that seemed to report conflicting information. So I emailed him asking what actually happened back at a childhood science fair. And he actually responded and recalled the history that knocked my report out of the parkVery hard for little Timmy to ask a quick question via email these days.There was a time in HS when I had several to-fro with DMR about Unix philosophy without fully realizing what a giant he was in our CS galaxy.

All the best wishes to someone so kind and smart, I’m glad it sounds like it was only minor.Something I really wish I knew immediately after my mom had a stroke is that the recovery that often happens over the days and weeks following a stroke as the brain adapts to its new normal is nothing short of amazing. My mom was nearly blind, unable to control her eyes, and mostly unable to speak. It was very, very bad, and we both thought her life was effectively over though neither of us said that to each other. A couple weeks later she walked out of the hospital and today she has almost no lasting effects.The only treatment she ended up receiving was time and monitoring because she got to the hospital so late (it happened on an island, hours from a hospital.) That’s not to undermine the importance of urgent treatment obviously. She was very fortunate. reply padolsey 7 hours agoparentThe biggest grudge I have against &#x27;stroke&#x27; is that it&#x27;s such an amorphous diagnosis. A heart attack, a similarly ischemic (or hemorhagic) event, often produces, say, one of a couple dozen lasting distinct symptoms. Some can be extremely severe and disabling, but it&#x27;s still a narrow enough concept that people know how serious it usually is. Conversely, strokes present in literally thousands of ways, from mild eye twitches to complete paralysis. My stroke&#x27;s effects will last for decades, and many aspects will never be &#x27;fixed&#x27;, but some of the immediate effects have waned significantly due to quick medical intervention.I wish Woz the very very best and that his stroke doesn&#x27;t produce too many lingering disabilities. Taking time for yourself in the aftermath is crucial. Sending thoughts to him, in spirit, from a fellow survivor. reply Bluecobra 5 hours agorootparentI’m sorry you had to suffer through that. My mother was a victim of amorphous diagnosis. She had sudden stroke symptoms and was immediately taken to the emergency room. She had the usual symptoms including blurred vision in her left eye and numbness on the whole left side of her body. Despite this, the hospital insisted she had glaucoma and dragged an ophthalmologist to come in on a late Sunday night only to diagnose her with a stroke. She needed an MRI and the hospital didn’t have anyone available to operate it at the time. She was transferred to another hospital 45 minutes away despite there being an excellent Level 1 trauma hospital 15 minutes away. (They were not affiliated with them so she couldn’t go there.)I lost a lot of faith in the healthcare system and doctors that night. This wasn’t a hospital in the middle of nowhere either, it was in an upper middle class neighborhood in the suburbs of Chicago. It was amazing she recovered fully from the stroke, though sadly passed away several years later of unrelated causes.I hope the best for Mr. Wozniak, this isn’t something I would wish on anyone. reply purplecats 2 hours agorootparent> I lost a lot of faith in the healthcare system and doctors that night.the trick is to realize how horridly hostile the system is to us without having to witness it firsthand.

Dude is just awesome and you can tell he loves the tech aspect so much. reply atleastoptimal 7 hours agoprevI wonder sometimes how Steve Jobs would have ended up had he not met Woz. Would he have started a company within even an order of magnitude of Apple? reply upwardbound 2 hours agoparentI think that without Woz to develop the first two product versions (at exactly the right place & time in history, in a field that Woz had been studying obsessively since childhood), Jobs would have achieved minor success at best.Perhaps Jobs would become a well-regarded author, or a city council member, or own a franchise of restaurants. Alternatively, his drug use, lack of a useful college degree, out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and his many other bad decisions could have led Jobs to end up homeless on the Berkeley streets like so many other hippies from his social circle. He might have died sunburnt and unwashed at age 45 from a heroin overdose, just as much as he might have been successful.Even if he avoided the catastrophic homelessness and destitution which befell the believers of the \"turn on, tune in, drop out\" movement that Jobs immersed himself in, I think his success would be no greater than any other successful person whose career takes them to the upper-middle class. Charisma and design sense can only take you so far, and the real lotto ticket was the \"right place right time\" factor which came from Woz, who was practically born to invent computers at a time when the inventors of computers could change the world.It was Woz who had dreamt of designing a computer since he was a boy, and who even in middle school taught himself computer architecture and circuit design at the Ph.D. level, and whose technical creativity was once-in-a-generation.Woz was super lucky that his passion was about something that history had ordained would become the next technology revolution (rather than e.g. having his boyhood passion be in ornithology & birdwatching). For every Woz, there are probably 10 or 20 equally brilliant kids whose passions unfortunately, through luck of the draw and no fault of their own, have very little societal or financial value.Jobs worked with Woz to get to the point where they had a computer company which Jobs could then grow by 1,000x.But without Woz, Jobs would probably instead be spending the years in which Apple grew big in a \"turn on, tune in, drop out\" lifestyle of crashing on friends&#x27; couches and doing nothing useful, until eventually there are no more friends&#x27; couches to crash on, and he becomes a shaggy and dirty person on the street, trying to get money for drugs. reply heatmiser 7 hours agoparentprevSteve would have always had the vision and the drive to see it through. My guess is that yes, Jobs would have started a company pretty similar in success to Apple but it probably would have taken him longer. reply atleastoptimal 6 hours agorootparentAfter Jobs left Apple, he had the ideal conditions to move on with another venture. Next did ok but only survived because Apple bought it. Could Jobs have done even as good as he did with Next without the Apple II&#x2F;Apple IPO reputational boost Woz gave him? reply user_7832 9 hours agoprevDoes anyone know how dangerous a stroke is at his age? Side note, but why do older people have strokes so more often? Young people have blood clots too. reply somenameforme 6 hours agoparentAs you get older your arteries gradually narrow, a process made even more severe by the buildups of plaque. This is all accelerated by obesity, lack of exercise, and so on. Aging, high blood pressure, and various other factors also causes arteries to weaken, making a rupture even more likely.All of this is part of the reason I think the &#x27;search for the pill&#x2F;shot of immortality&#x27; in modern times is little different than the search for the pool of immortality in ancient times. Everything breaks down over time and so to solve this, we&#x27;d need to fix everything, when we yet struggle to truly fix even a single thing. reply Andoryuuta 9 hours agoparentprevI had a TIA(mini-stroke) a few years ago in my early 20s.From what I understand: strokes are not more dangerous with age, but are much more likely to happen as you age.I was told that the the risk factor is a matter of how quickly the stroke is identified and how quickly you are able to receive medical care after the onset. Faster response == less time for brain matter to die due lack of blood. reply aag 9 hours agorootparentIf someone you know is showing signs of a stroke (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;stroke&#x2F;signs_symptoms.htm), get them to the hospital right away. Time is of the essence. Once you&#x27;re there, don&#x27;t let overworked personnel ignore them. My mother recently had a stroke. She had absolutely clear, textbook symptoms. She got to the hospital by ambulance right away, but busy doctors and nurses sent her home after two days, saying that she hadn&#x27;t had a stroke because it didn&#x27;t show up on an MRI. That night, she fell, broke her pelvis, and returned to the hospital. She waited over twenty hours to see a neurologist, who immediately recognized the signs, and declared that she had had a stroke. True treatment only began then. A second MRI confirmed that diagnosis.Triage isn&#x27;t always accurate, especially in overworked emergency rooms. reply piuantiderp 8 hours agorootparentWow, that sounds like third-world kind of treatment.

It might make more sense to retire in a LCOL place with good affordable healthcare rather than rely on Medicare. Heck, just get a good policy with evac to the USA if anything major happens you can&#x27;t handle out of pocket (and at that point, it is probably cancer or something anyways). As I get older, it becomes more appealing to consider.I had private insurance in China and it was wonderful. I could get an appointment quickly for whatever, the waiting room was really plushy, the deductibles were like 100-400 kuai, mostly the former. The biggest problem is that private insurance in China has a payout limit (around $100k&#x2F;year for the policy Microsoft gave me)...which...well...whatever. reply smallkitten 2 hours agorootparentHospitals in Thailand are actually pretty awesome.

    "title": "Coding with Voice Control: Exploring the Potential of Cursorless Plugin",
    "originLink": "https://xeiaso.net/notes/cursorless-alien-magic/",
    "originBody": "Cursorless is alien magic from the future Published on 11/09/2023, 1396 words, 6 minutes to read Just in time for me to start a new job at a new place, my RSI has decided to flare up.For the record, I'm fine, I've known this has been coming for a while. The flare-up is on its exit anyways. I've gotten lucky and I'm going to be fine. But it's still a bit of a bummer. The last time this happened, I was able to get by by doing mostly writing about technology things, but I think I'm going to need to be able to program again. I know I'm a bit of an emacs user, but for this I've been using visual studio code because of one extension in particular: Cursorless. Cursorless is a plugin that integrates with voice control software to let you do AST level code editing with your voice. This is crazy alien magic from the future. I've talked about cursorless before on my blog, but I have decided to really get deep into it this time around. The last time I used it, I didn't actually use it for much more than moving around the screen, but this time I'm going to try to use it for everything. I wish I had this as an input method for slack and discord messages. The most magic parts about this are the ideas of destinations and targets when it comes to cursorless inputs. Targets are individual anchors in a document and destinations are places relative to individual targets. Every single token in a document is given a hat over a letter with a color. These hats act as anchors that let you give commands based off of locations, destinations, and paths between them. Here's a simple example. Consider this code: function fetchBlog() { fetch(\"https://xeiaso.net/blog.json\") .then((response) => { if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(\"Network response was not ok\"); } return response.json(); }) .then((data) => console.log(data)) .catch((error) => console.error(\"Error:\", error)); } This is a fairly standard looking JavaScript function. But, cursorless puts a bunch of hats over all of the code so it may look something like this:So that's why your editor is full of random video artifacts?They're not artifacts, they're targets! Take a good look at that picture again: The hats are color coded above individual letters. The position tells you the name and the color tells you how to disambiguate it. For example, That word function would be referred to as green urge because the hat is green over the letter u. If I wanted to delete that word for some reason or if I wanted to move it somewhere else, I could use green urge as the target for that action. By itself, this gives you some pretty powerful actions and effectively lets you do spoken vim motions. But, that is only thinking in terms of simple actions that you can do with your editor. The real power of cursorless comes in from not only the idea of paths (such as green urge past green bat to select the function fetchBlog in that screenshot), but the fact that cursorless knows what the AST of the language is doing. This means that you can do things across the entire function, like deleting it or moving it somewhere else. As an example, here are the lambdas of this function visualized separately (with the \"visualize lambdas\" command): These AST units are also targets. This means that I can do things like select the body of a definition and then work off of that. So if I want to refactor this into an asynchronous function, the refactoring becomes trivial:That's pretty cool, but I don't think I'd be able to remember all of those commands.After a while, they just become second nature like Vim commands do. I have been forcing myself to use this over and over again for the past few days and it's starting to become second nature. I'm introducing individual commands at one of the time and building up into bigger and better things. The real magic comes when you start writing your own commands with the full power of Cursorless and Talon. In that example I just showed you, I have a action for inserting \"async \" before the function definition. Here is the code for that: [state] async : user.cursorless_insert(cursorless_destination, \"async\") You can break talon commands into two basic parts: patterns and captures. Patterns are the spoken words that you say and captures are the things that you want to extract out of what you say. In this case, the pattern is just the word async and the capture is the destination that you want to insert the word async before. Thecapture is a special capture lets you specify if you want something before or after a target. Of course, this is just a very simple example and it can get way more intricate than this. Here is the most complicated Talon rule I've written so far: (method|meth)[] [][over] [] named[over]: user.go_method(go_pointer or \"\", letter, go_visibility_1 or \"public\", text_1, go_visibility_2 or \"public\", text_2)What the heck is going on there? This looks like a lot, but it is actually really simple. This lets you declare a method in Go. In Go, a method looks like this: func (reciever *Type) MethodName() { // function body here or something } Pedantically, Go doesn't have methods in the traditional sense, it just has functions that take structs as the receiver (read: a hidden first argument but in a way that is namespaced to that struct in particular). Without something to automate writing this for you, you would have to say something like this: state funk args word reciever space star hammer type over go right space hammer method name args go right brack enter That's a lot of words to say. But, with this talon rule, you can just say: meth r raised type named method name overThat's still a lot of words.Well, yes, you're not going to be able to get over that. But this is at least more efficient and it makes more sense. I'm not going to be able to get rid of all of the words, but I can at least make it so that it's close to how I conceptualize it in my head.I guess that makes sense, but what do you mean by raised? I don't think go has raised types I know it has pointers but not \"raising\". What is raising? I'm glad you asked! This is something that I'm experimenting with to try to find a different way to explain the concept of pointers in Go. I think that one of the oversights in the Go language is that pointers use C-style syntax. This specifically has you use an * to lower a value from a pointer value to a normal value and & to raise the value from a normal value into a pointer value. Since I'm taking the opportunity to radically redesign the Talon bindings for Go, I want to try unifying the syntax of pointer values into the idea of raising and lowering to see how it makes it easier to understand Go programs. I don't know if this is a good idea, but you have to fuck around in order to find out. Maybe some parts of our industry are actually good. I really hope that I get led into the GitHub copilot voice beta soon, I want to compare how Talon does voice coding versus how copilot voice does it.

Now that I go to the gym 3-4 times a week, most all of my RSI issues have vanished. Strongly recommend. There is something crushing about wrist pain when your entire value is wrapped up in what you can make computers do.Also, I love the style of this blog with the chat-replies from friends. reply injidup 3 hours agoparentI had bad RSI for ages. What helps me and other comments have agreed is pulling excercises. Specifically I have a bar at home attached to the ceiling. Just hanging from the bar as long as you can and doing that regularly seems to stretch out the right muscles&#x2F;tendons. Don&#x27;t over do it but at the beginning I could only do 20 seconds. Now I can hold on for 1 to 2 minutes depending on the day.I have very little wrist pain any more.I also have a kinesis pro keyboard and a MX master mouse. They both add to the improvement. reply faichai 2 hours agorootparentFlip side to this, is I’ve had Carpal Tunnel for a while now, had surgery 2 years ago. It’s somewhat better and I am now active at the gym and in general it has helped a lot but extreme gripping such as deadhangs, deadlifts and heavy rows actually aggravates my symptoms. I started using straps for any weight over 50kg and my hands have got a lot better.I’ve found that when you’re going from (weak, sedentary) => (strong, active) it can sometimes be difficult to discern what activities are good or bad for your pain. Sometimes you need to work through pain to find relief and strength on the other side, but sometimes working through pain just leads to more pain. The boundaries aren’t always clear at the time. reply injidup 1 hour agorootparentYes..don&#x27;t push past your pain limits. I have an old elbow injury from climbing. In the past if I did too much with it like pull ups it would inflame and then be useless again for weeks.But slowly building up the hang time and then moving to 1 pull-up then to 2 and slowly over months to 5 and then 10 seems to keep it happy.Be careful and slow but consistent and results should be good.( See your doctor of physio for advice ) reply Roark66 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is interesting, it reminds me of the (sort of) famous \"tree hanging\" exercise. Which goes like this. Go to a wooded area, find a tree with a strong branch above your head. Grab it and hang off it for a while. Do it daily for a brief time.Supposedly this exercise helps in all sorts of problems that arise in a sedentary lifestyle (hands, arms, back etc).Now, the only problem with doing it here is that most trees here are pines and strong branches start 20m above the ground... reply yread 2 hours agorootparentYou can get a climbing hangboard and hang it over a doorway. Do a pyramid training (2, 4, 6, 8, 6, 4, 2s with 5s pause in between) and your fingers and wrists will get much stronger reply cmplxconjugate 2 hours agorootparentI use a Beastmaker 1000 hangboard and follow the Emil&#x27;s Sub-max Daily Fingerboard Routine on the app Crimpd each day. Absolutely amazing results within a month. I really suggest everyone gives it a try. reply trhway 3 hours agorootparentprev>What helps me and other comments have agreed is pulling excercises.variation of this - my wife half my weight does her Aikido exercises on my wrists when the wrists start to remind about themselves. reply beebmam 5 hours agoparentprevFor people reading this comment about RSI and considering this recommendation: please see a doctor and a physical therapist first before you adopt a gym routine. It is very, very easy to hurt yourself if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing and you already have an injury. Speaking from personal experience. reply justworkout 3 hours agorootparentPeople always chime in with this and it&#x27;s weird. It&#x27;s just scaring people and making them think exercise is more dangerous than being sedentary (it isn&#x27;t). Have some common sense and don&#x27;t jump into something that hurts and you&#x27;ll be fine. Watch some videos of how to do established exercises, start with far less weight than you think you can handle and slowly work up to a higher amount over the course of weeks (so you know you&#x27;re not bending in weird ways), and be consistent with it.You can hurt yourself doing anything. Nobody says to consult a doctor before doing anything else, but there&#x27;s lots of fear mongering around exercise. Going from sitting at a desk all day to doing some weightless squats, curling tiny weights, and bench pressing a bar isn&#x27;t going to ruin your body. It&#x27;s only risky if you&#x27;re physically disabled and already know it.I even see people saying you should see a doctor before you start walking or jogging. No. Start slow, and if it majorly hurts your bones and joints, then talk to a doctor because you may have something wrong. If you just feel a burn in your muscles after a while and an ache in your muscles the next day, you&#x27;re fine. You&#x27;re getting stronger. reply dragonwriter 3 hours agorootparentYou seem to be knee-jerking and ignoring context.The recommendation was not \"see a doctor before starting an exercise routine if you are sedentary\".It was \"If you are going to try to use an intense exercise pattern as a treatment for an RSI, consult a doctor first\".> Start slow, and if it majorly hurts your bones and joints, then talk to a doctor because you may have something wrong.If you have an RSI, you already have something wrong; that&#x27;s your starting point. And a lot of common RSIs affecting the risk and elbow can have a lot of impact on ability to safely do lots of common exercises (especially with free weights) at weights way (like, literally, an order of magnitude or more) below what would even be useful from a strength perspective. And, yeah, the right focused exercises can help, and if you&#x27;ve got a decent doctor, they (or, more likely, the physical therapist they refer you to), will actually provide you both appropriate exercises for your particular RSI and also appropriate guidelines on how to avoid exacerbating it with other exercise. reply heavyset_go 2 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t let hubris get in the way of getting an informed medical opinion when it comes to not making your existing injuries worse with exercise. I&#x27;m speaking from experience as someone who once thought like you do, at least when it came to my own health. Take injuries seriously. reply justneedaname 2 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s only risky if you&#x27;re physically disabled and already know itAre you not physically disabled in some way though if you have RSI? reply j45 3 hours agorootparentprevAgree. just like you wouldn’t over do it walking the first time. reply weird-eye-issue 38 minutes agorootparentprevDoctors and PTs never helped my wrist, forearm, and arm pain but finding a really good personal trainer and going to the gym 3+ times a week for several months is what finally did it reply p-e-w 4 hours agorootparentprevThe vast majority of doctors, when presented with a patient asking such a thing, will do a 30 second \"examination\" (if you&#x27;re lucky), then spout some platitudes about exercise being beneficial in moderation (which you could have gotten from a lifestyle magazine or a fortune cookie), then usher you out after 5 minutes so they can see the next patient waiting in line.Unless you know the doctor personally, or are rich enough to see high-class private practitioners who will actually pay attention to you because of your money and&#x2F;or status, that would be a gargantuan waste of time. Needless to say, I too am speaking from personal experience. reply zaptheimpaler 4 hours agorootparentThis might be true if you just go ask a generic doctor with no training on the subject but someone trained in sports medicine or a physiotherapist can be very helpful. reply xena 5 hours agoparentprevYeah, at first when the RSI pain started, it felt it was really scary. Like viscerally scary in a way that is hard to describe unless you have felt that kind of fear. realistically, though knowing that I can use this tool to be able to code, even without the use of my hands, it makes me just feel calm. Obviously, I wouldn&#x27;t want to lose use of my hands, but should that reality happen it is something that I could actually live with and tolerate. Would suck to give up video games entirely though. It&#x27;s amazingly ironic that coding without your hands, ends up being faster than coding with your hands, but it wouldn&#x27;t be reality if it wasn&#x27;t ironic eh? reply cableshaft 2 hours agorootparent> Would suck to give up video games entirely though.You don&#x27;t necessarily have to do that. I&#x27;m adding voice recognition into the game I&#x27;m working on right now, for example. It helps that it&#x27;s a turn-based strategy game to begin with, though.And there are players that manage to play games with limited or no mobility in their hands at all, with the right accessible controllers. reply targetx 2 hours agorootparentPlaying games on PC has been a trigger for me for a long time and gets uncomfortable quickly. I got a PSVR2 headset last year and it&#x27;s a great way for me to play games and not be in the same mostly static position all day. I can play games on it without any discomfort (other than wearing the headset itself which isn&#x27;t great if it&#x27;s a really hot day) and you can switch up sitting&#x2F;standing which I also like. reply Aerroon 3 hours agoparentprevThe thing that seems to counteract my wrist pain is pulling exercises. Essentially anything where the wrist is pulled away from the forearm: pull ups, deadlifts, bent over rows, even stretches against the wall. Pushing against the wrist made things worse for me, but the pulling exercises counteract it. reply Cthulhu_ 1 hour agorootparentI couldn&#x27;t do push-ups when starting with a personal trainer due to the wrist pain, but the exercises helped; I&#x27;m not sure if it was pulling action, or grip strength &#x2F; forearm training though; the theory with the latter is that the large muscles pick up more of the slack and offload the smaller painful muscles.that, or just improved blood flow allowing repairs and trapped shit to be taken away. reply j45 3 hours agorootparentprevExercise bands can help with these too. reply kraig911 4 hours agoparentprevI would also advise seeing a doctor but I&#x27;ll say my doctor recommended me something very similar. I&#x27;m not able to go to the gym but what has helped me is I have a bucket with rice in it (I guess you could also use sand?) and I just twist my hand within the bucket of rice while holding and squeezing a tennis ball in it. Do it in a circular motion.One thing I thought was interesting is he said that ortho doctors don&#x27;t really think ergo keyboards help. I use a kinesis advantage 360 where I can (I still prefer a regular keyboard) I don&#x27;t see much in the way beyond help with shoulder pain. I&#x27;ve had surgery to fix my RSI&#x2F; tunnel nerve inflammation. Anyways where I&#x27;m going with this is I do think exercise is a big help. reply danieldk 3 hours agorootparentJust to counteract your latter point, switching to a split key well keyboard with good palm rests did largely solve my wrist issues.Of course, every person and diagnosis is different. reply creer 4 hours agorootparentprevNo one setup helped me either. What did help me was recognizing that I had a problem and actively changing things - like varying small setup changes like angle to the table. That was mostly enough to stop stressing always the same parts. reply SubGenius 4 hours agorootparentprevThe Kinesis (and now the Moonlander) has really helped with the pain in my hands from severe nerve damage (from a coma) though. I understand it&#x27;s not exactly RSI, so the mechanism is different. I agree with you about exercise. At this point, I&#x27;m nervous to rely on just one single change, so a multi-frontal attack is needed. A consistent stretching routine is probably what helped me deal with pain the most... reply locuscoeruleus 1 hour agoparentprevCompetitive RTS, programming and being able to stand on my hands for minutes at the time left me with wrists that hurt all the time. After I started climbing all wrist and back pain has disappeared. reply heavyset_go 2 hours agoparentprevIf you&#x27;re going to do this, make sure you work out the muscles that support your wrists before you start lifting heavy things.If you already have an injury, you want to build up supporting muscles first so you don&#x27;t end up making it worse, and start slow. reply ubercore 3 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve found this true for a lot of unexpected things. It makes sense in the end, but is a little unintuitive at first that lots of deadlifting completely fixed some crippling back pain I was going through at one point. reply j45 3 hours agoparentprevI had one flare up that got my attention.Strengthening is definitely a huge part of it if not most .. more often than not.A few other things helped, if you have them use your benefits to verify with a physiotherapist or professional.Wrist support:M-brace makes an excellent and minimally invasive strap. Good to west while sleeping if you twist it while sleeping. There’s an older version of this which was an angled bracket which works in many positions. Helps relieve from fatigue or not get fatigued as easily.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m-brace.com&#x2F;produit&#x2F;wrist-support-132&#x2F;Laptops are generally awful ergonomics especially if you aren’t as active as may need to be. Invest in an ergonomic keyboards, ergomice, vertical mice, trackpads. Variety is the best ergonomics. Minimize or stop using laptop keyboards. I use Logitech k860, Microsoft ErgoSculpt keyboard, kinesis freestyle widest separation at times, even though they are not mechanical. Slim keys are actually pretty good.If you have a standing desk use it more often to change up the angles and use different muscles.Strengthening:- A gyroball works well. Builds up the core muscles.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;NSD-Essential-Strengthener-Exerciser-...- Wrist curls, not too much weight, get advice. Don’t overdo it.- Finger strengthening using hand grips- If you can find some hand massage or scraping tools and learn how tonier them they can alleviate a lot of stiffness in hands and forearms. reply pillefitz 3 hours agoprevYears ago I struggled with RSI as well, and found suggestions to read about the methods of John Sarno here on HN. While it initially triggered by BS radar, I was desperate enough to try his methods - and they worked!Additionally look into trigger points: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.triggerpoints.net&#x2F;There&#x27;s certain points in my arms and back, which when pressed hard enough, lead to complete and immediate pain relief (which led me to experiment with Sarno&#x27;s method in the first place, as he suggests psychosomatic causes) reply scandox 58 minutes agoparentMy wife had serious back issues. MRI showed multiple issues with lower discs etc...surgery was being pushed strongly. She wasn&#x27;t keen because her sister&#x27;s surgery had not really helped much.She found Dr Sarno. To this day I&#x27;m not entirely on board with it...but whatever went on it worked. The surgeons looking at her MRI were totally baffled. It still showed all the issues and as one said \"you shouldn&#x27;t be able to even walk around without pain\".One thing Sarno says which I find interesting: he claims that the correlation between MRI imagery and pain is very weak. In other words you have people with a clean MRI who are in agony and you have people with all kinds of issues showing who are absolutely fine. reply asmor 12 minutes agorootparentA lot of people have bulging disks without pain.About half in this study: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;8208267&#x2F;So the MRI should be treated as a correlating factor only. No bulging disk and pain is probably the more immediately useful finding, because you take out a likely cause. reply d0mine 27 minutes agorootparentprev> correlation between MRI imagery and pain is very weakIt is not just some fringe opinion from a single doctor e.g., here&#x27;s recommendations from Barbell Medicine https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;mdwj5ORPmX0?si=DOVVJCGgLe_U0GDT reply proto-n 2 hours agoparentprevTrigger points afaik are a widely accepted concept, my physical therapist tells me that something like 90% of the time her patients&#x27; problems are due to trigger points. Or more correctly due to cramping and tense muscles, which trigger points can help alleviate.The trigger point is basically just a place where you can push on the muscle, and apparently when you push on a muscle that&#x27;s tense, it&#x27;s forced to relax itself.

Lifting weights is a good ouch generally, playing video games is a bad one. But my most downvoted comment is a response to someone being really dismissive about ear damage from loud music. I was in a band and it kind of messed up my ears. I don&#x27;t have RSI and consider myself lucky, I can still work because my job is typing.The comment that set me off was \"how about simply not playing so fucking loud?\"I would like you to look at the parallels between your comment and the one that set me off, and look at my response and look at how a response from someone who IS suffering from it would see your response and realize how it&#x27;s just... not helpful. \"how about just don&#x27;t get hurt like I didn&#x27;t?\" Easy!

This, then, is very similar to textobjects in vim &#x2F; evil, but with a spoken component.I can see a lot of promise in this. Particularly if this integrates a sort of \"record and perform\" feature. Say I&#x27;m doing action X with my keyboard, and I know I need to do Y after, and 1) I can see all the required text on the screen, 2) it&#x27;s a simple operation. I could then speak the command for Y while executing X, and then press the button to execute the voice command after I finish X. Much better than having to alternate between typing and speaking.Alternately typing and speaking would lead to using different parts of our cognition, and writing software isn&#x27;t very verbal once you&#x27;ve grokked the syntax.

Because if it’s too high, you’re hunched all day. Your shoulders are up, you’re tense.I also changed my chair. I had a classic office chair, but again too high (I’m average height, not a millimetre more), and with wheels. The wheels were killing me — all day your legs are trying to keep you stable, which sounds like cool exercise but isn’t. Turns out just being stable is better.So I bought a chair. A wooden chair with four legs. About AU$80 from IKEA.These two things alone transformed my RSI.

Remembering what I learned from piano lessons at music school: keyboard should be approximately under your fingers if you relax your arms and bend your elbows 90 degrees. Where playing, you you have to engage your arms, not only fingers.2. Putting screen at approximately eye level, give or take.Yes, the above means a laptop is by default unsuitable for serious work. An external keyboard and&#x2F;or display is a must.3.

And yeah I have no association with Cursor.Cursor is pretty smart about what to prompt GPT with. In the case that you described, you might prompt it with something like \"check for prod\" and I expect it would work. The reason it would have a better success rate is that it&#x27;s usually quite good about what context to send over - it would likely pick up the type definitions (if you have those) or other files that do similar things and send those over as well.To give a full answer to your question, I actually wouldn&#x27;t prompt it with \"check for prod\" at all because that would be underutilizing GPT. I would probably prompt at the complexity level of something like \"edit this component so that if we&#x27;re in prod, we show a warning message at the top\".

We are excited to announce that earlier this year in July, Servo received a NLnet grant to enhance several aspects of Servo. Under this grant, our primary focus is to: Complete float support in Servo Support more languages in inline layout Add initialsupport Floats Supporting floats in Servo is an ongoing effort since mid-2023. We’ve made significant progress on floats, but there are still some issues that need to be addressed before Servo can boast a fully-compliant implementation of CSS floats. Our objective is to achieve an average pass rate of over 80% for /css/CSS2/floats/ and /css/CSS2/floats-clear/. You can track the results on our WPT dashboard Last week, we surpassed this for the floats tests, with an 82.2% WPT pass rate: We’re also nearing the milestone for floats-clear, currently at a 73.3% pass rate: More languages in inline layout Servo’s layout engine lacks crucial features for rendering languages that don’t use the Latin alphabet. This includes proper font selection, support for right-to-left scripts, and logical properties. Our aim is to improve Servo’s support for displaying a wider variety of content. Initialsupport HTML tables are an important and widely used feature. Servo’s new layout engine doesn’t support tables yet, which leads to incorrect layout of many web pages. Under this scope, our main focus is to implement initial support for tables in Servo, so that it can render tables used on Wikipedia. As we progress and achieve these milestones, we’ll cover them in more detail in subsequent blog posts. Stay tuned for more updates! Back",

Can&#x27;t believe Mozilla wasn&#x27;t interested in it.Not only the idea of an engine with great security and performance is an excellent one, but I also love the idea of a web engine as a component. This for some reason seems to have disappeared in modern times.IE used to have an ActiveX control back in the Windows 9x days. You could embed a web engine anywhere you wanted. KHTML also worked like that. And in modern times... nothing. Neither Firefox nor Chrome seem to have interest in that kind of usage. Qt WebEngine thankfully exists, but in my understanding has a bit of an antagonistic relationship with Chrome, because Chrome doesn&#x27;t care for that kind of use.Plus Chrome is a Google thing, and Google things in my experience are their own world, making them annoying to build and integrate.So I&#x27;m very much looking forward to having a viable alternative to integrate into our code. Both solving security concerns and hopefully making the integration less painful. reply bluejekyll 19 hours agoparent> I&#x27;m very excited about Servo. Can&#x27;t believe Mozilla wasn&#x27;t interested in it.This doesn’t feel like an accurate statement. It’s probably better described that Mozilla funded it as a research project, realized that it was going to cost a lot more money and time to bring it fully to the market and decided to save the money (and distributed that money to execs and others in ways that were not inline with their projected morals).Based on what I’ve read from their blog posts, Mozilla then took what they could from Servo and incorporated it into Firefox, which means they were able to get some value from the project.My guess is that if someone were to have offered Mozilla a lot of money and an unlimited timeline to complete Servo, they would have done it. reply dralley 17 hours agorootparent>My guess is that if someone were to have offered Mozilla a lot of money and an unlimited timeline to complete Servo, they would have done it.My understanding is that they tried to do that with VR (turn Servo into the first VR-capable browser and work on browser-technology-based AR overlays) and even had a partnership with Magic Leap at one point, it just never really went anywhere. reply bluejekyll 11 hours agorootparentAh, yeah, I forgot about that.

This for some reason seems to have disappeared in modern times.I have used CEF, WebKit, and WebView2. Only the former is easily embeddable cross platform, and as soon as it became popular, Google put a lot of resources into disallowing Google login from it or any other embedded browser[0]. I had to abandon my own CEF-based browser because of this. While I abhor the business practice, there&#x27;s nothing I can do. If my browser can&#x27;t login to Google products, it can&#x27;t see much adoption and I don&#x27;t have the time to try and win a cat-and-mouse game against their detection methods.If we want embedded browser components to be more mainstream where anyone can develop a browser, we&#x27;re going to first have to address that large companies block them if they get too popular but the embedding company is not popular. Ideally an embeddable non-Android Gecko would come about because FF is too big to block (lots of talk in the past, and I even PoC&#x27;d stealing the window handle[1]).

Can some please explain what is it that Mozilla uses then to render pages, and which parts did Mozilla rewrite in FF? Did some parts of Servo made it into FF, and is FF contributing back to Servo?sorry, too many questions perhaps. reply seba_dos1 1 hour agorootparentFirefox uses and has always used Gecko as its engine. Some parts that originated from Servo got transplanted into Firefox over the last few years, but overall it&#x27;s still Gecko. reply seanw444 17 hours agorootparentprevThey transplanted some components, most namely Stylo. But Servo in its entirety is far from complete. reply wredue 19 hours agoparentprevPossibly memory safe (possibly. Helix, for example, recently had a build that was crashing due to memory safety problems) doesn’t explicitly mean “great security”. reply jiripospisil 16 hours agorootparentAre you talking about this?

I am WAY beyond fiddling with my tools when they give me trouble. I just moved back to neovim. reply jedisct1 18 hours agorootparentprevNot even memory safe.It has many \"unsafe\" and \"transmut\", and this is without the bazillion external dependencies it also depends on. reply jiripospisil 16 hours agorootparentI mean they currently have 12 unsafes and 4 transmutes (who knows how many in dependencies). I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s many when the code base is clocking at around 53k of Rust. Compared to languages such as C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Zig, which provide no safety at all, it&#x27;s still an improvement to at least know where to look when address sanitizer is screaming at you (see the bug I linked to in the sibling comment). reply wredue 11 hours agorootparentBoth zig and modern C++ have safety that is generally good and catches swathes of issues.I’ve been writing zig for a couple months now and have only once accidentally leaked in a test, and haven’t once accidentally messed up a buffer.Not saying you can’t, because zig definitely has escape hatches, but idiomatic zig has proven quite easy to stay safe without even thinking about it.No. Neither is as pedantic as rust, but zig has been a joy to work in compared to either C++ or Rust in my opinion. reply rvz 19 hours agoparentprev> Can&#x27;t believe Mozilla wasn&#x27;t interested in it.It is because it doesn&#x27;t make money. An expensive research project (Servo) that was not worth the effort for Mozilla.Mozilla needs to find better ways of making money and not depending on Googles&#x27; money.Now thanks to the US v Google anti-trust trial, Mozilla doesn&#x27;t know if they should support Google for keeping them alive for their hundreds of millions of dollars or being going against them for Google to be broken up for more competition.Either way Google&#x27;s search AND browser monopoly is held together by paying its competitors such as Apple (for Safari) and Mozilla (for Firefox). reply dale_glass 19 hours agorootparentThat sounds like an amazing failure of imagination to me. I see at least 3 excellent angles.1. Chrome beat Firefox in the stability&#x2F;security area. Its usage of multiple processes, sandboxing, etc is excellent, while Firefox failed to adapt. Servo seems to have an excellent potential for coming up on top there, being both more secure, and having higher performance.2. There are actually markets interested in security. Think say, banking, military, industry, IOT. There are various laws coming requiring companies to take security seriously. Servo has a lot of potential there too. There&#x27;s potential for both projects that have security as a selling point, and regulatory compliance.3. Embedding. Like I said, using a web engine as a component seems to have been forgotten in modern times. Surely that can be sold to somebody, because there are plenty use cases for embedding web engines in stuff. reply dralley 17 hours agorootparent>1. Chrome beat Firefox in the stability&#x2F;security area. Its usage of multiple processes, sandboxing, etc is excellent, while Firefox failed to adapt. Servo seems to have an excellent potential for coming up on top there, being both more secure, and having higher performance.They did adapt, and the HN types got mad at them for breaking the old-style extensions, which were effectively incompatible with multiple processes, sandboxing, performance, etc. And were totally incompatible with Servo at a fundamental level.>2. There are actually markets interested in security. Think say, banking, military, industry, IOT.Those industries are infamous for doing things like having applications that only support IE9 in Windows XP. Security may matter to them in theory but in practice it is clearly far lower on the priority list than stability and supporting one golden path. Getting them to adopt something novel and experimental for use cases they want to be thoroughly boring and unchanging for 15 years is never ever going to happen.As someone that compiled and ran Servo and submitted a couple of patches, it had a long way to go (years of development) before it would have been production ready in its entirety. reply emn13 18 hours agorootparentprevWhile this is great brainstorming, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a viable business plan. Having a large highly qualified dev-team working on experimental stuff for now over a decade and no likelihood of completion anytime soon and without a business plan is pretty tricky, even for a non-profit.In general, for research of that type (of scale) it doesn&#x27;t strike me as generally very viable to rely on commercial support, and such a niche technicality is surely not going to collect enough donations to run on that alone. If we want to fund this because it&#x27;s an interesting option for the future in the long term, governments are going to need to chip in - and it looks like that&#x27;s at least partly at play here (or even primarily), i.e.: system working as designed. reply wila 18 hours agorootparentprev> 3. Embedding. Like I said, using a web engine as a component seems to have been forgotten in modern times. Surely that can be sold to somebody, because there are plenty use cases for embedding web engines in stuff.It&#x27;s not forgotten. Microsoft has WebView2 which uses the same engine as MS Edge and it can be included in your .net applications.If OTOH you want an ActiveX then you can buy AntView, which wraps WebView2 in an ActiveX control.Disclaimer: AntView is a control sold by my company. reply tentacleuno 19 hours agorootparentprev> Now thanks to the US v Google anti-trust trial, Mozilla doesn&#x27;t know if they should support Google for keeping them alive for their hundreds of millions of dollars or being going against them for Google to be broken up for more competition.Why would they not publicly support Google when Google are the ones keeping Mozilla alive? I&#x27;m all for journalistic integrity, but I don&#x27;t think Mozilla could pull that one off. reply znpy 20 hours agoparentprev> Can&#x27;t believe Mozilla wasn&#x27;t interested in itThe fact that mozilla wasn’t interested in that really tells a lot about their priorities reply danShumway 17 hours agorootparentI was really disappointed to see Mozilla drop Servo and I think it was the wrong decision for them to make, but seeing this take mere hours after seeing people in a thread about Android Firefox bashing Mozilla for prioritizing a rewrite of their mobile browser is certainly some whiplash.And to a certain extent, I get it, I also think Servo was a more valuable project than Fenec. But let&#x27;s not pretend that there&#x27;s an obvious correct answer to \"should Mozilla rewrite its browsers from scratch?\"Again, I say this as someone who wanted Mozilla to stick with Servo. It was a bad decision for them to drop it, I think there was a lot more value that could have been extracted from the project. But if Mozilla had stuck with Servo, I guarantee there would be people on HN right now saying, \"why are they rewriting their browser engine, the current one works fine, why aren&#x27;t they doing X? Shows a lot about their priorities. This is the problem with Mozilla, they&#x27;re too focused on theory and engineering projects instead of just shipping a good browser.\" There&#x27;s no winning. reply fabrice_d 16 hours agorootparent> I think there was a lot more value that could have been extracted from the projectWhat exactly? They extracted the 2 pieces that worked better than the existing gecko stack (Stylo and WebRender). I&#x27;m a big fan (and small contributor) to Servo, but it&#x27;s far behind on anything else (layout, networking, security, web api support...). reply danShumway 13 hours agorootparentOn a small level, I think that some of the areas it&#x27;s behind on (security, layout) might have eventually turned out to be improvements. Stylo and WebRender were behind Firefox when they first began development as well, they were experiments to see if Rust could enable differing patterns. I personally think those experiments would have been useful to try and replicate for layout at the very least, although I don&#x27;t know for sure if they would have yielded fruit.On a bigger level, I think having a more easily embeddedable Firefox could change the dynamics around V8 and Chromium could end up being pretty important for the health of the web overall, including the health of Firefox.There&#x27;s an argument to be made here that none of that potential is gone because, hey, Servo is still being developed. But I think it could have gone faster with Mozilla&#x27;s support behind it for longer, I think they would have served as an effective advertising&#x2F;hype engine behind the technology. I think the dominance of Chromium for embedded applications does influence how developers approach the web in some minor ways.On a really out-there level, I would like to see HTML-like interfaces proliferate in more apps, and Servo in particular has a very modular approach that could make it more feasible to bring in the DOM without bringing in languages like Javascript (yes, manipulation and events and all that stuff would need to be accessible without JS, but... it&#x27;s certainly easier than it would be with Chromium, Stylo already makes some interesting applications possible). If I had to pick a company to push that effort that I didn&#x27;t thing would horribly mess it up, Mozilla would be high on my list. And I vaguely maybe suspect that pulling more browser technologies out of the web could open up more technical fields and niches for Mozilla to get its hands into. Right now what that area mostly looks like is Electron or embedded Chromium. At most you have embedded JS engines like V8.I&#x27;m hoping that there&#x27;s some potential to do more interesting things, and I think it could have been valuable to Mozilla and it could have increased developer investment&#x2F;mindshare if Mozilla was a bigger player in those areas.But that&#x27;s just my instinct, maybe I&#x27;m wrong. reply paulryanrogers 19 hours agorootparentprevOr they (Firefox folks) learned what happens when you (Netscape) try a major greenfield rewrite (Netscape v5) so ambitious that it becomes the example of why one should never rewrite.And instead just back ported the lessons learned to make Firefox&#x2F;Gecko better years earlier than a rewrite could. reply dahauns 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s why Servo exists in the first place. That&#x27;s exactly the reason why always has been intended as a research engine, with an explicit focus on high modularity, and easy portability of single components, several of which were then incorporated into Firefox.Especially the latter wasn&#x27;t some kind of salvage, trying to squeeze value out of some theoretical project. It was an explicit goal from the beginning. reply ZeroGravitas 18 hours agorootparentFacts don&#x27;t matter, this is one of those QAnon things were people collectively fan-fiction an apocalyptic battle for them to be on the right side of based on nothing more than a vague dislike of women and minorities. reply jeltz 19 hours agorootparentprevThat they got a ton of valuable code and lessons which improved Firefox a lot? Seems like the investment into Servo paid off really well. reply mrd3v0 19 hours agorootparentprevThey fired everyone working on it and completely abandoned it while giving the CEO a million dollar pay raise the same year.When are we going to talk about how openly corrupt Mozilla has become?

The real question in my opinion is what can we do about it? Start an awareness campaign? Stop using Firefox? Stop donating to Mozilla? reply maleldil 18 hours agorootparent> Stop using Firefox?And use what? A Chromium reskin and give up the web to Google?Mozilla has (many) problems, but it remains the main organisation fighting for the open web. reply unflxw 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d argue that the EFF is the main organization fighting for the open web. reply Aeolun 18 hours agorootparentprev> Mozilla has (many) problems, but it remains the main organisation fighting for the open web.Well, it’s a different organisation from MS and Google anyway. I’m not sure how much I’d say they’re fighting for an open web, so much as I’d say they’re fighting for their slice of it. But the end result is more or less the same. reply GuB-42 18 hours agorootparentprevThere is not much we can do ourselves, they are hurting themselves more than we can hurt them.We don&#x27;t want to punish the corrupt, we want to save Firefox from them. If would be great if some organization could fork Firefox and work with Servo to make a usable browser, but that&#x27;s going to be really expensive, and the new browser will have to make a name for itself. Also the organization will have to do better than Mozilla in terms of corruption, which, again, is not a given when a lot of money is involved. reply emn13 17 hours agorootparentprevWhile very frustrating, it&#x27;s just not reasonable at all to call that fraud or corruption. To make that case, you&#x27;ll need to also make the argument that the CEO&#x27;s remuneration is unreasonable to the given market rate; and more specifically, that you might be able to hire somebody else and achieve similar results for meaningfully less cash, and the CEO and board know this, and they&#x27;re overcompensating intentionally.Now: I agree that the pay is absurd! I&#x27;m quite willing to believe she&#x27;s not worth it, too. But she&#x27;s hardly the first CEO to have ridiculous pay; nor am I convinced the board is overcompensating her for corrupt reasons - it may simply be a difference of perspective. And - perhaps I&#x27;m wrong, and this pay is a going market rate and a hypothetical cheaper replacement would do worse - I really don&#x27;t believe that, but to call something corruption I&#x27;d need to be rather sure of that and of their knowledge of it. reply nicoburns 20 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s cool to see the work on Servo since Igalia picked it up. There was a lot of tech debt to work through due to years of minimal maintenance, but they seem to have been making real progress.My personal hope is they push hard on the modularity angle. Seems to me that:1) there&#x27;s probably a niche to be filled by an OSS browser engine focussed on embedabilityand2) That it could be a huge boon for the long-term health of the web platform if there are build-your-own-browser \"lego building block\" libraries that people can mix and match to create new engines. reply capableweb 19 hours agoparent> 1) there&#x27;s probably a niche to be filled by an OSS browser engine focussed on embedabilityAbsolutely. Electron or something Electron-like with Servo embedded could be a nice outcome. Tauri already fills that niche a bit, but uses whatever the OS provides, rather than embedding anything.

    "originBody": "Microsoft krallt sich Zugangsdaten: Achtung vor dem neuen Outlook Das neue kostenlose Outlook ersetzt Mail in Windows, später auch das klassische Outlook. Es schickt geheime Zugangsdaten an Microsoft. Lesezeit: 4 Min. In Pocket speichern vorlesen Druckansicht Kommentare lesen 495 Beiträge (Bild: IB Photography/Shutterstock.com) 09.11.2023 16:18 Uhr c't Magazin Von Dirk Knop Ronald Eikenberg Stefan Wischner Das neue Outlook ist nicht, was es auf den ersten Blick scheint: ein Ersatz für das Outlook von Microsoft Office – jedenfalls noch nicht. Was es aber auf jeden Fall ist: entschieden zu neugierig. Microsoft lobt das neue Outlook in höchsten Tönen und will Nutzerinnen und Nutzer zum Umstieg bewegen. Doch Achtung: Wer das neue Outlook ausprobiert, riskiert die Übertragung seiner IMAP- und SMTP-Zugangsdaten zu Mailkonten sowie sämtlicher Mails an Microsoft-Server. Zwar erklärt Microsoft, der Wechsel zurück auf die bisherigen Apps sei jederzeit möglich – die Daten liegen dann aber schon beim Unternehmen. Microsoft kann dadurch die Mails mitlesen. Nach dem 2023-Update von Windows 11 findet sich als empfohlene App das neue Outlook im Startmenü. (Bild: Screenshot / rei) Im Windows-Startmenü von Windows-11-Geräten mit 2023-Update taucht inzwischen das neue Outlook als empfohlene App auf. Auch der Outlook-Client selbst bietet den Test der neuen Outlook-Version mit einem Schalter \"Das neue Outlook\" an. Die befindet sich noch in der Entwicklung, soll aber 2024 in Windows etwa das Mail-Programm und den mitgelieferten Kalender in Windows ersetzen. In einem aktuellen Techcommunity-Beitrag erklärt die Microsoft-Angestellte Caitlin Hart zudem, dass auch das klassische Outlook damit ersetzt werden soll. Anders als bei den Windows-Apps Mail und Kalender steht der Zeitplan dafür jedoch noch nicht. Neues Outlook: Warnung vor Datenübertragungen Beim Hinzufügen eines Mail-Kontos im neuen Outlook, das nicht von Microsoft gehostet wird, sondern etwa auf Firmen-Mail-Servern liegt, zeigt das Programm einen Hinweis. Er verlinkt auf einen Support-Artikel, der lediglich ausformuliert, dass Nicht-Microsoft-Konten mit der Microsoft-Cloud synchronisiert werden, wobei bislang Gmail-, Yahoo-, iCloud- und IMAP-Konten unterstützt werden. Das macht das neue Outlook auch in den Fassungen für Android, iOS und Mac. Das bedeutet demnach, dass Kopien der \"E-Mails, Kalender und Kontakte zwischen Ihrem E-Mail-Anbieter und Microsoft-Rechenzentren synchronisiert\" werden. Damit erhält das Unternehmen vollen Zugriff auf alle Mails und kann diese lesen und auswerten. Damit wolle Microsoft Funktionen bereitstellen, die Gmail und IMAP nicht bieten würden. Das neue Outlook liefert einen Warnhinweis, dass es Daten an Microsofts Cloud-Server überträgt. (Bild: Screenshot / rei) Der Hinweis macht stutzig: Was überträgt Microsoft dadurch wohin? Beim Anlegen eines IMAP-Kontos konnte die c't mitschneiden, dass Ziel-Server, Log-in-Name und Passwort an Microsofts Server übertragen werden. Zwar TLS-geschützt, aber im Tunnel laufen die Daten im Klartext zu Microsoft. Ohne darüber zu informieren oder nachzufragen, genehmigt sich Microsoft selbst Vollzugriff auf die IMAP- und SMTP-Zugangsdaten von Nutzern des neuen Outlooks. Beim Einrichten von IMAP-Konten schickt das neue Outlook die Zugangsdaten und Serverinformationen an Microsoft. (Bild: Screenshot) Andere Zugänge Bei dem Schwenk vom alten Outlook auf das neue wird es parallel dazu installiert. Bislang eingerichtete IMAP-Konten werden nicht übernommen, aber das in Windows hinterlegte Konto schon. Bei der Prüfung mit Google-Konten kam die Authentifizierung mit OAuth2 zum Zuge. Dabei erhalten Nutzerinnen und Nutzer eine Authentifizierungsrückfrage und es landen immerhin keine konkreten Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft, sondern ein Zugriffstoken, den Nutzer auch wieder zurückziehen können. A response to our request for a statement from Microsoft is still pending. At this point in time, however, we have to warn against trying out the new Outlook without thinking. In addition to all the emails, some access data even ends up with Microsoft. Microsoft was already noticed at the beginning of the year with such brazen data redirections. After Office updates on Mac computers, Outlook redirected the data to Microsoft's cloud server without any queries. At that time, the solution was to delete IMAP accounts and set them up again. However, this is obviously no longer helpful with the new Outlook. Do you have a tip?

Could it have anything to do with LLM’s? Either way, if I were IT, I’d be livid. reply hedgehog 4 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s because IMAP is not very good for disconnected or mobile operation, and if you&#x27;re willing to put a server between the on-device client and the IMAP server you can do much better at the cost of sharing credentials and content with the server. Not a new idea, mobile mail systems going back to Danger, BlackBerry, Good, etc have done this and probably there was precedent before that. reply flower-giraffe 9 minutes agoprevWhen combined with the rate limiting on 365 email api and ultimately removing imap access this seems like a strategic goal to capture our data.The dark patterns pushing content to one drive from office apps and web access opening attachments and keeping them in one drive is another example of this data grab.It’s an example of shareholder value trumping customer value, the primary purpose of cloud is to make you pay more without having to provide more in return. reply einr 1 hour agoprev1.

Extend (New Outlook supports IMAP, but only in the sense that we copy all your stuff to our Cloud)I think the only solution is ThunderbirdSome while ago, there was a bit of backlash over their re-design, but after actually using the more recent versions, I have to say that they did a good job - you can toggle the display density of the UI elements and it&#x27;s still a good mail client with reasonable performance and usability.I can even sign e-mails with OpenPGP and did you know that it also has a built in RSS feed reader (a bit clunky, but having news sites&#x2F;blogs be a folder that&#x27;s right next to my e-mail accounts works brilliantly well)? In addition, I have it both on my Windows and Linux machines, surprisingly consistent across the board.Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.

What? Not sure if this is a mistranslation but this makes absolutely no sense. TLS is encryption.

The password will be transmitted in clear before and and after that transport.This is not at all comparable to other \"store my passwords inside the cloud\"-systems, where the passwords are encrypted and decrypted on the users&#x27; devices, without the encryption key going to the cloud provider - that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s handled in Password Managers, Chrome Auto-Fill etc.And I would expect Microsoft asking the user for explicit consent \"May we take your IMAP password and transfer it and store it in our cloud?\" in easy to understand wording so people understand the consequences (for example getting fired for having punched a gapping hole into your employers security policies like \"Don&#x27;t share this password with anyone\")That expectation would match the law in the EU.And in addition, inside the EU it would also have to guarantee that the password will only be stored on servers inside the EU, and not end up, for example, with the NSA. And even then it still might not be legal.And from a user&#x27;s perspective: Certainly a big chunk of users that have been using email software for the last decades would assume that an email client installed on your PC is doing the IMAP access locally. There is no need for your IMAP credentials to go to Microsoft. Merging your local mail store from multiple sources inside the client is what email clients have been doing for the last 20 years. There is absolutely no need to move this to the cloud. Yes, my computer can handle merging email folders. reply nhinck2 4 hours agorootparentprevI would expect Microsoft not to be on the receiving end of my plaintext password. reply xorcist 2 hours agorootparentprevIMAP supports a multitude of authentication standards, including hash and key-like, so the above is not necessarily true, however it is unlikely that Outlook supports them.Client certificates are supported by both Thunderbird and K9, would prevent this type of issues.In the cloud first era, your value is derived from how much customer data is under your control. Not for resale primarily but for stickiness. It&#x27;s like the dot com era, only for real this time. reply steve1977 1 hour agorootparentprevI would expect that my local e-mail client is making the connection to my IMAP server. Not a connection to Microsoft servers which then in turn connect to my IMAP server. reply fulafel 4 hours agorootparentprevAnother reason to use something else than passwords with IMAP for authentication. reply magicalhippo 4 hours agorootparentprevI would expect them to at a bare minimum encrypt it using a temporary public key before transmission, in case TLS connection was MITM&#x27;ed, and I&#x27;d expect them to use those fancy hardware security modules (HSM) they have[1] to protect it on their side.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;key-vault&#x2F;managed-hs... reply weikju 2 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t matter how well they protect it, they still have the credential, and they decrypt it in order to be able to use it, so for all intents and purposes, it&#x27;s in the clear _for Microsoft_ (and whoever else manages to have access). This is not how it should be. reply magicalhippo 31 minutes agorootparentObviously, and this is something they should communicate clearly.But if they were to provide such a \"service\" I&#x27;d expect them to minimize exposure, including the steps I mentioned. reply magicalhippo 29 minutes agorootparentprevI was tired and forgot to add they should first check if the IMAP server supports XOAUTH2, and in that case require that to be used.Still not a great solution but at least not passing the password around. reply bravetraveler 7 hours agoparentprevTransit vs rest, maybe?I suppose they&#x27;d prefer it be not transferred at all, but if it were... to be bundled up safely [for storage] before exfiltration reply NOWHERE_ 3 hours agoprevWithout google translate (german): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heise.de&#x2F;news&#x2F;Microsoft-krallt-sich-Zugangsdaten... reply Kim_Bruning 7 hours agoprevThis could become a bit of an issue.

It&#x27;s only for local IMAP accounts (think: your ISP email account) where you type the password directly into the settings that Microsoft is doing this.Doesn&#x27;t make this any better- but before you worry that MS has your Google account password, they don&#x27;t. reply whoopdedo 2 hours agoparentNo, they only have a Oauth bearer token that lets them impersonate you to the IMAP server. But it&#x27;s not your password so that&#x27;s cool, right? reply mrweasel 2 hours agorootparentFor Google and Apple at least, wouldn&#x27;t you get a message saying that a new device has attempted to connect, asking you to confirm? reply mschuster91 1 hour agorootparentNo. The dirty secret is that OAuth tokens, JWTs and whatnot are just as bad as passwords and cookies in terms of credential theft, the difference is only in built-in expiration and scope. reply mrweasel 1 hour agorootparentBut would you not get a \"A new device has accessed your account\" warning? Or it that skipped because the token is already validated? reply dist-epoch 54 minutes agorootparentI didn&#x27;t get such warning when I connected Outlook to my Gmail.But I had to click accept on the Google form requesting my permission to grant Outlook access. So I was informed when the app was connected.I&#x27;m not sure how you would count \"new device\", since that token is going to be used by a random Microsoft cloud server, potentially different every time. reply mschuster91 1 hour agorootparentprevNo. A bearer token (which almost all credentials are) doesn&#x27;t say anything about the device that is using it.The sole exception are tokens tied to a device&#x27;s HSM (TPM, Secure Enclave, TrustZone, ...) - you can&#x27;t clone these onto another device. reply dist-epoch 57 minutes agorootparentprevSo just like every other connected app, right?How are they supposed to access the emails without some sort of token? reply mrweasel 2 hours agoparentprevWhile it&#x27;s probably not many companies that works this way, and use Outlook, I do wonder what happens if your IMAP is on a closed network.It is completely possible to have SMTP and IMAP be on internal networks and not on the internet (SMTP obviously needs a way to rely to a internet connected buddy). reply Fischgericht 11 hours agoprevGerman IT magazine has uncovered that with Windows 11 Update 23H2 if you accept the \"recommended\" new version of Outlook the client may be uploading your secret IMAP credentials to the Microsoft cloud.If you are trying to add a \"local\" IMAP&#x2F;SMTP account, there is short notice that Outlook needs to \"synchronize\" your IMAP account with the Microsoft cloud.It does NOT explain that what this actually means is that it will send all your credentials including your passwords in clear text to Microsoft.Microsoft&#x27;s support document to this also only mentions:\"Syncing your account to the Microsoft Cloud means that a copy of your email, calendar, and contacts will be synchronized between your email provider and Microsoft data centers.\"No word that it means that they are uploading your passwords.This is evil. And at least in the EU, illegal.I have not yet found any report on this in english-language IT media, and therefore have provided a Google Translate link to the report in German. reply jofla_net 8 hours agoparentbig if true, i mean what a footgun.

Mr. Borman, who lived at a retirement community in Billings, died one week after fellow astronaut Ken Mattingly, who helped bring Apollo 13 home following an onboard explosion. Mr. Borman became America’s oldest living former astronaut after the 2016 death of John Glenn, one of the seven original astronauts in NASA’s Mercury program. Story continues below advertisement After graduating near the top of his U.S. Military Academy class, Mr. Borman became an Air Force test pilot of supersonic jet fighters. He once refused to eject from an F-104 fighter whose engine failed at twice the speed of sound, instead managing to steady the plane until it recovered power. He won an award for flight safety. Advertisement “With delicious irony,” he wrote in his 1988 memoir, “Countdown,” “they also gave the award to another pilot for not restarting his engine under almost the same circumstances. He had bailed out instead, and the investigators found that if he had restarted his engine, he would have blown the plane into five million pieces.” In 1962, Mr. Borman was one of nine men tapped for NASA’s second astronaut corps and served as command pilot of two NASA missions that laid essential groundwork for the 1969 moon landing. Story continues below advertisement During the December 1965 flight of Gemini 7, he and astronaut James A. Lovell Jr. set an endurance record in space. They spent two uncomfortable weeks orbiting the Earth in what Mr. Borman later described as a capsule the size of “the front seat of a Volkswagen.” Under nonstop medical monitoring, the men put up with boredom, heat and unsanitary conditions, even sharing a toothbrush for part of the mission. Lovell joked afterward that he and Mr. Borman had decided to get engaged. Advertisement In space, Gemini 7 got within six feet of the crewed Gemini 6, proving that NASA could perform the rendezvous maneuvers needed in lunar missions. Until Mr. Borman’s and Lovell’s orbiting medical experiment, space historian Andrew Chaikin said in an interview, NASA wasn’t sure that humans could survive such a long trip in space. Story continues below advertisement Mr. Borman and Lovell were rewarded with leadership roles on Apollo 8. The mission had been planned to orbit Earth, but intelligence reports that the Soviets were readying a crewed mission around the moon led NASA to change its plan, sending Mr. Borman, Lovell and crewmate William Anders more than 230,000 miles away from Earth and to orbit the moon 10 times. It was a bold gamble for the space agency and for the three astronauts, who became the first humans to leave Earth’s gravitational field and the first to orbit the moon. Anders snapped an iconic photograph, known as “Earthrise,” showing the planet’s dawn above the lunar horizon. Mr. Borman coordinated the Apollo 8 crew’s live Christmas Eve message, during which the three astronauts read from the first 10 verses of Genesis, their television camera trained through the capsule’s window, toward the moon. “And from the crew of Apollo 8 we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you — all of you on the good Earth,” he said in the broadcast’s final moments. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “Earth looked so lonely in the universe. It’s the only thing with color,” he said years later, of that Christmas Eve. “All of our emotions were focused back there with our families as well. So that was the most emotional part of the flight for me.” ‘The Colonel’ Within the space agency, Mr. Borman was known for an unyielding commitment to protocol. When director of flight crew operations Deke Slayton sent small bottles of contraband brandy on Apollo 8 for the astronauts to enjoy as a Christmas treat, Mr. Borman refused to let anyone partake. “You know, I didn’t think that was funny at all,” Mr. Borman told a NASA oral historian in 1991. “If we’d have drunk one drop of that damn brandy and the thing would have blown up on the way home, they’d have blamed the brandy on it. You know, I wanted to do the mission and I didn’t care about the other crap. I didn’t care about the food or anything else. I just wanted to get it done.” Advertisement Story continues below advertisement After Apollo 8, Mr. Borman joined NASA administration as deputy director of flight crew operations. He retired from the military and the space agency in 1970. He later cited family stress as a major reason for leaving the astronaut corps, in particular his wife’s alcohol dependency. Share this article Share Each spouse, he wrote in “Countdown,” “was expected to appear to the public as the Perfect Wife married to the Perfect Husband who was a Perfect Astronaut in a Perfect American Family raising Perfect Children. But how they were supposed to accomplish this was totally ignored.” According to one account, at the moment on Christmas Eve when Apollo 8 was about to circle the moon and lose its signal to Earth, Susan Borman asked mission control to pass along a coded message to her husband: “The custard is in the oven at 350.” It was a long-running inside joke, her way of assuring Mr. Borman that she was okay, and that everything at home — “the custard” — was under control. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “No comprendo,” he replied to mission control, engrossed in his duties. It took him some time to realize what she had been saying. “Why did she never say anything to me?” Mr. Borman later asked, referring to his wife’s anxiety during that period, in his memoir. “Because at that stage of our lives, it wouldn’t have done a damned bit of good. This was Frank Borman she was married to, a man determined to complete whatever the Mission happened to be. I would have been upset if she had confided what was eating away at her.” After leaving NASA, Mr. Borman became vice president at Eastern and, in 1976, was named chief executive. He found the storied carrier, once led by the World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker, close to bankruptcy. He returned it to profitability, implementing cost cuts and even appearing in commercials. He won plaudits for some aspects of his management style, even working the baggage carousels during the holiday season. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “The Colonel,” as Eastern employees called him for his Air Force rank, banned alcohol at events for corporate executives and did away with other perks for senior managers. He drove a battered 1969 Chevy convertible to work, setting an example of thriftiness. His successes were short-lived. When the U.S. government began deregulating the nation’s airlines in 1978, Eastern wasn’t equipped to ride out the instability, industry analyst Richard Aboulafia said in an interview for this obituary. The company had built its business model during an era of government-set fares and markets. As ticket prices fell and revenue decreased, Eastern had trouble cutting costs. Further, Mr. Borman became mired in protracted, hostile salary negotiations, and employee morale slumped. He resigned in 1986, after Eastern — the country’s third-largest carrier — was acquired by low-cost Texas Air for $676 million. (The airline continued to struggle, selling its shuttle business to future president Donald Trump in 1989. Eastern shut down operations in 1991. USAir acquired the Trump Shuttle the next year.) Aboulafia said Mr. Borman was a “remarkably accomplished fighter pilot at the dawn of the jet age, a remarkably accomplished astronaut, and then a respected airline executive — but he was in the wrong place at the wrong moment.” In his memoir, Mr. Borman recalled driving home and crying on his wife’s shoulder when Eastern’s board sold the airline. “For the first time in my life, I hadn’t accomplished a mission,” he wrote. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Frank Frederick Borman II was born in Gary, Ind., on March 14, 1928. He suffered from breathing trouble, and the Bormans relocated to Tucson in the hope that the dry desert air would improve the health of their only child. He would later recall “a halcyon existence,” capturing Gila monsters and walking downtown to watch movie westerns on Saturdays. He excelled in school, became quarterback of the Tucson High School football team and met Susan Bugbee, his future wife, during his senior year. Mr. Borman built model planes in childhood and, as a teenager, worked odd jobs to earn money for flight lessons. In 1950, the year he married, he graduated eighth in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. He received a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 1957. His wife died in 2021. Survivors include two sons, Frederick and Edwin Borman; four grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. The “last thing I ever wanted to be was a professional astronaut,” Mr. Borman told the NASA oral historian. Invoking the baseball Hall of Fame pitcher, he added: “I just try never to look back. Like Satchel Paige said: Somebody might be gaining on you if you look back.” Share Comments",

It was basically extraordinary that NASA gambled so extravagantly, combining multiple steps in the planned sequence into one mega mission in order to get back on schedule after the disastrous fire and meet Kennedy&#x27;s aspirational goal. Chances of success? (surviving the mission), maybe 50%.Thinking about Frank Borman being alive and well and still flying his plane has been a favourite thought for me, and I&#x27;m very sad to have to retire it. reply heresie-dabord 3 hours agoparentIt is thought-provoking to consider how much the success of the Apollo programme depended on courage as well as other qualities of character:\"When Shepard was grounded in October 1963, Grissom and Borman became the prime crew of Gemini 3.[41] Grissom invited Borman to his house to talk to him about the mission, and after a long discussion, decided that he could not work with Borman.[34] According to Gene Cernan, \"the egos of Grissom and Borman were too big to fit into a single spacecraft\".[44] Slayton therefore replaced Borman with John Young.[41]Slayton still wanted Borman for the two-week flight [...] so Borman was assigned as backup commander of Gemini 4, with Jim Lovell as his co-pilot. [...] Prime and backup crews trained for the mission together, and Borman found the experience as a backup valuable, amounting to a dress rehearsal of their own mission.[49]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Frank_Borman#Project_Gemini reply ZaoLahma 2 hours agorootparent> ... and after a long discussion, decided that he could not work with Borman.This I wish was (still?) acceptable. It&#x27;s like somewhere along the way we decided that everyone must be able to cooperate effectively and efficiently with everyone, and largely (do our very best to) ignore all the problems that brings.I&#x27;ve only been at one company where they tried to address this, and actually let us form our own teams. It worked better than expected. reply lalabert 8 hours agoprevApollo 8 was the greatest of all the Apollo missions.

I know JAXA and ISRO work very closely with each other, but seem to be much more probe and rocket driven for financial reasons. reply chihuahua 8 hours agorootparentMakes sense; if you want to build a lunar base, you gotta have Venezuela and Azerbaijan on your team, otherwise it&#x27;s basically futile. reply somenameforme 5 hours agorootparentIn living memory of most of us, China was just a deeply impoverished nation known for little more than exporting cheap unreliable crap. Any achievement they did make was framed as being stolen from somebody else. Yet now, their successes in space, industry, science, and technology are completely taken for granted. Funny how quickly things change! The status quo of the world is constantly shifting. Those nations which strive to advance, will. Those nations which rest on their laurels of achievements past, will gradually find themselves with little left to cling to beyond those laurels.I think it&#x27;s awesome to see previously neglected nations beginning to be able to take part in major space programs. They also come with unique benefits. Like somebody else mentioned, for one thing Venezuela is in a dream scenario for launches. Eastern exposure to the ocean and substantially closer to the equator than e.g. Florida. This means ships taking off from there are able to more optimally sort of &#x27;sling shot&#x27; off of Earth&#x27;s rotation - the Earth rotates Eastward, and fastest at the equator. Same reason that in Andy Weir&#x27;s Artemis novel, Kenya ended up being a world leader in space. And there&#x27;s no logical reason this wouldn&#x27;t happen. Countries can be developed, but they can&#x27;t be moved. reply schiffern 2 hours agorootparentnext [–]> Any achievement they did make was... stolen from somebody else. Yet now their successes in space, industry, science, and technology are completely taken for granted.The two aren&#x27;t necessarily in contradiction, you may note. Do we have reliable evidence showing Chinese IP theft has slowed?Many nations \"bootstrap\" internal industry with organized mass IP theft. The US extensively (and quite intentionally) stole from Britain&#x27;s industrial IP, for instance.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samuel_Slater reply adrian_b 49 minutes agorootparentBesides the often quoted IP stealing from GB, there are also more recent examples.At the end of WWII, not only the Soviet Union has moved piece by piece many industrial factories from Germany to Russia, but also USA and GB have \"stolen\" massive amounts of IP from the occupied Germany.One of the most notorious cases in how the American industry of making magnetic tape recorders (e.g. Ampex) and of making magnetic tapes for them has been founded based on the samples brought back from Germany.The case of the liquid-fueled rockets directly connected to this Apollo story needs no further mention.Whenever they could get away with it, no country has refrained from copying foreign better technology.While there in no doubt that China must have done this frequently in the past, in recent years there are little chances for them to benefit from this, because now in many domains their products are much more innovative than anything made in USA, and also in research publications they have many that are also more innovative.I do not believe that sabotaging the Chinese companies that were on the brink to take most of the market share from US companies like Qualcomm and Micron has been the right strategy for counteracting the Chinese threat.This is just a temporary setback for them and there is the risk that they could emerge from it stronger, no longer fearing any US blackmail.This should have been either saved for a more critical moment, when it could have a greater effect, or the so-called \"sanctions\" should have been real sanctions, and not just anti-competitive measures, i.e. they should have been tied to some political demands made to China, e.g. to recognize Taiwan as an independent country, or to give up their claims to extend their maritime borders. reply schiffern 7 minutes agorootparent>not only the Soviet Union has moved piece by piece many industrial factories from Germany to Russia, but also USA and GB have \"stolen\" massive amounts of IP from the occupied Germany.Not just the Soviet Union. The USA also moved factories piece by piece.[0]The reverse example occurred during inter-war period, when US companies extensively outsourced to (cheap labor in) Germany. The US companies who exported their factories all made huge profit on paper, which promptly evaporated the moment war broke out.

Assuming the upcoming Starship test flight goes well, we might see a test of refueling operations in late 2024, 2 years is likely to be cutting it really close for operationalizing refueling and crew rating the HLS. Particularly on the paperwork front.I&#x27;d say that if everything goes perfectly from this point onwards, 2026 might see the uncrewed test of the system and maybe a crewed landing by 2028.Similarly with Blue Origin&#x27;s HLS, maybe New Glenn finally flies in 2024, but they too have so many steps to prove out first. JAXA and ISRO IIRC have seats on a future Artemis crewed mission, which would probably be how they get their first boots on the Moon. ISRO would probably be too busy with its LEO station at that point to make a crewed lunar lander, but JAXA and ISRO would most likely contribute with base components or related (rovers, orbital infrastructure).The Chinese plans for a lunar base by 2035 are essentially imaginary in terms of partnerships, particularly since of them, China is the only one with any worthwhile space program (the Russian program being in steep decline and would be lucky to even pull off a proper ISS replacement by 2035 let alone a worthwhile contribution to a lunar base). reply alephnerd 7 hours agorootparent> the Russian program being in steep declineIdk.The Russian program seems to be weaker at operationalizing in 2023 but still has a lot of IP from the USSR era.China is making massive strides but doesn&#x27;t seem to have as deep IP experience yet.Imo I wouldn&#x27;t oversell the Chinese and undersell the Russians.> JAXA and ISRO would most likely contribute with base components or relatedThat tracks, and fits with their specialities.Also, I didn&#x27;t realize JAXA, ESA, and ISRO are part of Artemis. NASA needs to have a better PR team. The Chinese Lunar Base is getting so much PR despite being much more behind ArtemisEdit: they signed the Artemis accords, they are not part of the similarly named Artemis Program reply dotnet00 4 hours agorootparentI think Russia has mostly lost the perks of its USSR legacy in space to time, and I would argue has even less current experience than China on making new systems. Most of the USSR stuff would&#x27;ve been like NASA&#x27;s stuff from that period, extremely reliant on the experience and intuitions built up by the engineers of the time such that reusing the designs from that time now is almost as much work as just designing a new thing from scratch. Russia hasn&#x27;t invested in propagating that knowledge to younger generations, and the people from that time are quickly aging out of the workforce. So the only institutional knowledge they really have left at this point would be Soyuz, which, while a workhorse, is certainly not enough on its own to cover the systems needed on a space station&#x2F;base of any sort.JAXA, ESA are considered partners on the Artemis program (at least based on Wikipedia, there does not seem to be an explicit list of partners on NASA&#x27;s site), they&#x27;re training astronauts to eventually be sent to the Moon in a similar arrangement as with the ISS. JAXA and ESA (along with the Canadian Space Agency) are also contributing various key components for the Gateway space station. Plus, the ESA is an important player with the Orion capsule which Congress-critters seem committed to forcing to be the center of the program regardless of technical and financial sense.As for ISRO, I think I mixed things up a little. I think I had heard talk about the potential for an arrangement to fly a vyomanaut to the ISS on Dragon, assumed that it was about the agreement having been made and then mixed it up with Artemis. Turns out none of that was real, there does not appear to be any talk of sending an vyomanaut to the ISS. reply idlewords 4 hours agorootparentprevPart of that NASA plan depends on people figuring out how to put Starship into orbit, how to refuel it in orbit, and then how to safely land it on its tail on the moon. These are three enormous technical challenges that I can&#x27;t imagine being solved by 2026, even if all the dysfunctions at NASA proper were to disappear tomorrow. reply szundi 3 hours agorootparentMaybe one could just decide that concrete blocks and debris can be collected any time int the future from a field area and just allow it to launch reply Shawnj2 2 hours agorootparentThe bigger issue is that part of the reason why Starship didn’t make it to orbit is because debris from the launch pad being destroyed was kicked back into the engines. reply khuey 8 hours agorootparentprevJAXA and ESA (among others) are part of the Artemis program&#x27;s human spaceflight component. reply alephnerd 7 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t realize that.

    "originBody": "Storage 49 It's perfectly legal for cars to harvest your texts, call logs 49 Just because they store messages in a way owners can't access doesn't mean it's a privacy violation, US court rules Brandon Vigliarolo Thu 9 Nov 2023 // 16:05 UTC In response to five class-action lawsuits, a Washington appeals court has decided that Honda and several other automakers did nothing wrong by storing text messages and call records from connected smartphones. Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, and General Motors were all facing charges in separate but related class-action suits that all claimed they violated Washington state privacy laws. The cases were all dismissed in court earlier this year, and the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit decided [PDF] this week they weren't going to reopen the cases to further litigation. The Circuit judges hearing the case lumped all of them together because \"the factual background and legal issues are virtually identical,\" and dismissed the appeal not because the automakers hadn't done anything wrong, but rather because the claims didn't meet the Washington Privacy Act's (WPA) statutory injury requirements. \"To succeed at the pleading stage of a WPA claim, a plaintiff must allege an injury to 'his or her business, his or her person, or his or her reputation,'\" the judges ruled. \"Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, a bare violation of the WPA is insufficient to satisfy the statutory injury requirement.\" In other words, it's A-OK for your car to \"automatically and without authorization, instantaneously intercept, record, download, store, and [be] capable of transmitting\" text messages and call logs since the privacy violation is potential, but the injury not necessarily actual. The 9th Circuit judges' determination was based on the dismissal of a fifth class-action lawsuit in Washington that made the same arguments against Ford, which was dismissed in late October on identical grounds. One of the same 9th Circuit judges, Michael Daly Hawkins, was on the appeals panel that made both decisions. We asked Honda and lawyers for both sides of the case to comment but haven't heard back. We already give up our privacy to use phones, why not with cars too? Ford SYNC 3 infotainment vulnerable to drive-by Wi-Fi hijacking Mozilla calls cars from 25 automakers 'data privacy nightmares on wheels' Car rental firms told: Tell your customers about in-car data slurps Per the first amended complaint [PDF] filed in the Honda case, Honda infotainment systems in vehicles manufactured from 2014 onward \"store each intercepted, recorded, and downloaded copy of text messages in non-temporary computer memory in such a manner that the vehicle owner cannot access it or delete it,\" plaintiffs argued. \"Even if the text message is deleted from the smartphone, the Honda vehicle retains a copy in on-board memory, even after the smartphone is disconnected.\" The same goes for call logs, the class-action complaint argued. Plaintiffs accusing Honda of WPA violations pointed to Maryland-based Berla Corporation, which manufactures equipment \"capable of extracting stored text messages from infotainment systems\" as a reason for owners to consider the data harvesting a privacy concern. According to the suit, Berla software isn't generally available to the public, and is designed for law enforcement use. \"Copies of text messages and call logs stored on Honda vehicles can be, and are, retrieved by unauthorized users of Berla's equipment without any password, fingerprint, face image, or other security measures, thus bypassing any security measures Plaintiffs and class members employ to secure data on their phones,\" the complaint alleged. The Honda case and those involving Toyota, VW, and GM were all dismissed with prejudice, so the only way for the cases to go is up to the Supreme Court on further appeal. It's not immediately clear if further appeals are planned. ® Sponsored: Decreasing data warehouse downtime Share More about Automotive Privacy Smartphone More like these × More about Automotive Privacy Smartphone Narrower topics BMW cookies Electric vehicle Ford HONOR iPhone Privacy Sandbox Samsung Galaxy Ace More about Share 49 COMMENTS More about Automotive Privacy Smartphone More like these × More about Automotive Privacy Smartphone Narrower topics BMW cookies Electric vehicle Ford HONOR iPhone Privacy Sandbox Samsung Galaxy Ace TIP US OFF Send us news",

Most run Linux, QNX, or Windows CE, with some proprietary UI system on top.* These machines usually store data in an onboard database in flash (sometimes just SQLite).* Sometimes, phone data is captured using standard Bluetooth mechanisms (Message Access Protocol MAP and Phone Book Access Protocol PBAP) which require authorization on the phone side. Some vendors implement an additional \"are you sure you want to share your information\" check on the head unit side, and others don&#x27;t.* This data is cached on the head unit so that finding a contact to call or reading a text message doesn&#x27;t require 10 minutes worth of Bluetooth nonsense.* Some vendors inadequately purge this cached data when a Bluetooth pairing is removed from the head unit.* Berla sell data extraction exploits to law enforcement, just like other forensics vendors do for mobile phones. Sometimes this can extract latent data and sometimes active data.My advice:* Never authorize a head unit to download your contacts or SMS.* If you use a rental car, Factory Reset the head unit when you leave.That&#x27;s decent protection for most people. I didn&#x27;t find any evidence pointing to a central server upload, a conspiracy to build an LE database, etc. It&#x27;s just typical crappy hardware manufacturer-made software leaving data around that shouldn&#x27;t be left around, creating an opening for forensic vendor exploits to slurp the data. reply akira2501 14 hours agoparent> This data is cached on the head unit so that finding a contact to call or reading a text message doesn&#x27;t require 10 minutes worth of Bluetooth nonsense.This is such an early 2000s idea.

I left shortly after CarPlay was announced and our response was \"That will never catch on.\" reply amelius 11 hours agorootparentOnce you bought the car they now have a monopoly on the software that is available.

I know it&#x27;s hard when you want that nice car, but considering the above, the only way is just not buying the car with software lock-in. Only this stimulus can have some effect. reply patmorgan23 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is.

This \"infotainment\" BS harks back to vastly overpriced stock car radios of years gone by.All we need is a place in the dashboard to mount our phones. Phones already have big-ass touchscreens and anything else we want... except of course now the audio outputs have been removed.We should simply have a well in the dashboard with replaceable inserts that snap in to accommodate different-sized phone models, which would connect to the audio system and power. But no... we still have phones bouncing around in the cabin or attached to hokey third-party claws, and janky-ass Bluetooth which (how many years in now?) can&#x27;t handle simple music playback reliably.Every car in my household has an auxiliary input for audio and no support for audio over Bluetooth. One is a 2013 Mini, so it&#x27;s not as if they&#x27;re ancient.And that&#x27;s just fine. And if it MUST be overcomplicated, then yes... AirPlay seems to be the way. reply neuralRiot 12 hours agorootparent> All we need is a place in the dashboard to mount our phones.

To some extent, though, that&#x27;s down to the phone UI. iOS, ummm, 6 if I remember correctly was supposed to be more \"car-friendly.\" Of course, that was another Jony Ive failure... it actually changed the system font to a spindly outline that was hard enough to see in normal conditions, let alone in a car. There was absolutely nothing in that OS that offered a \"car-friendlier\" experience. I was so glad to see that pompous hack leave Apple.If you look at CarPlay, it chunks the functionality down to a few big icons on the screen at a time. No reason that can&#x27;t be done on the phone itself in a \"car mode.\"Anyway, this is what I ended up doing: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;krRXQwP reply fzzzy 10 hours agorootparentThat was 7, 6 was the last &#x27;good&#x27; one. reply ShadowBanThis01 9 hours agorootparentAh, thanks.Too many regressive releases to keep track of... reply MarioMan 11 hours agorootparentprev>We should simply have a well in the dashboard with replaceable inserts that snap in to accommodate different-sized phone models, which would connect to the audio system and power.

They sell holders designed specifically for your model of phone which attaches to a custom-fit mount for your car&#x27;s make and model. It&#x27;s pricy, at about $75 for a holder-mount combo, when cheap Amazon alternatives are closer to $10, but it overcomes a lot of the problems you list.

I find it very sad that you have to prove injury despite the fact that is is clearly not in a user&#x27;s benefit. Laws are always playing catchup to tech and we shouldn&#x27;t have to play wackamole for every new absurd way our privacy is being abused just becawe can&#x27;t prove that police aren&#x27;t doing parallel construction to avoid the direct \"injury\" to us. reply bri3d 13 hours agorootparentWhy do I think these features are not nefarious?* There&#x27;s an obvious, legitimate want for the vehicle&#x27;s head unit to ingest this data, in order to display a UI (or provide a voice UI) which allows the user to call a contact by name or read a recently received text message. Is this a poor implementation concept which has mostly been supplanted by better implementations (Android Auto &#x2F; CarPlay), sure, absolutely but it&#x27;s not some thing that was added for the express purpose of \"stealing\" information. It&#x27;s a long-standing set of features which use obvious, standardized Bluetooth technologies to fill an obvious, straightforward user need. Nothing weird there.* There&#x27;s no sign whatsoever that there was any collusion with law enforcement in the construction of these systems.

Often after an acquisition or two.I personally know a release engineer that was required to quietly send all new code changes to an NSA ftp server, presumably to make sure none of the bugs they rely on were fixed.If something is in popular use and -can- collect data covertly, it will be co-opted to do so by someone for power or money without fail. reply zlg_codes 8 hours agorootparentI want to include with your great post that civil action will not stop a government hellbent on gathering data.Destroying the means of surveillance, capturing targets, and reverse blackhatting is what will work. reply mattw2121 14 hours agoparentprevBig opportunity for one of the big car rental agencies to come out looking great by advertising their \"privacy focus\".

Which is good?The tricky part here is when someone is steadily stockpiling things which seem likely to cause truly irreparable harm in the future. But that act is not itself causing harm yet. For example, stockpiling tons of sensitive data.Another example, a mine with a nearly overtopping tailings dam full of toxic chemicals is a disaster that is almost inevitably guaranteed to happen.But civil law gives little to no method of stopping that disaster until it has already killed countless people, since - as noted - it hasn’t actually happened yet. And there is no actual guarantee that it will! Potential options do exist, but are so time consuming and high risk, good luck.But it does give methods for those people’s relatives to get compensation after the fact at least. Which is better than some alternatives.Which is why other types of regulatory frameworks exist, at least in some cases.Unfortunately, as in the tailings dam case, and the icy sidewalk case, the actual smartest move is to just avoid them all together - somehow. Move? Take a different route?Not always possible though, and being constantly on the lookout for these things is exhausting and infeasible for most.Not sure how that is possible privacy law wise though, even for the most alert? Never engage with anyone or give anyone anything true? reply myself248 12 hours agorootparentWorse, you&#x27;ve got a Hobson&#x27;s choice when it comes to using many of these systems. If you decline to get your data hoovered up, you simply can&#x27;t participate at all. In this way, the car&#x27;s contact-download is pretty benign, you can still make phone calls even if you decline the contacts.But it&#x27;s worse pretty much everywhere else. A few years ago, my data was in a breach of a health-care company I&#x27;d never heard of and never dealt directly with, they were some sort of back-end broker several layers away from us patients. Recently I went to sign up for new insurance, and I asked for a list of all companies that might handle my data, and copies of their most recent cybersecurity audit. Of course I didn&#x27;t get a useful reply, and as a &#x27;customer&#x27;, I have no useful levers to pull. I have no useful information to use when selecting an insurer. And I have no recourse unless someone starts siphoning money out of my account AND I notice and can prove that it happened because of a breach.\"Never engage with anyone\" equates directly to \"Go be a hermit in the mountains\". If that&#x27;s where our privacy laws have gotten us, I think we&#x27;re doing something wrong. reply RHSeeger 9 hours agorootparentprevTherein lies the issue. This type of thing shouldn&#x27;t be civil in nature. Things that are dangerous to others and have a likelihood of causing significant damage... should be criminal in nature. Someone driving drunk is putting others at risk, but the injury isn&#x27;t actualized until it is. A company forcing it&#x27;s drivers to work too many hours, driving while unable to get enough sleep, is putting others at risk; but the injury isn&#x27;t actualized until it is.Along the same lines, a company gathering extensive details on the communications of and connections of others (especially without their permission) is putting others at risk. And, much like the previous example, the damage isn&#x27;t actualized until it is. But it needs to be stopped _before_ the damage happens. Which means it needs to be criminal. reply simbolit 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is why such things should be criminal offenses! reply lazide 13 hours agorootparentYup!

That&#x27;s the only reason this lawsuit got thrown out.

This makes the judgement much more reasonable. reply nonameiguess 15 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not an attorney, but I think a lot of the Internet misunderstands the law. It is legal to do this, apparently, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the court is saying it&#x27;s okay or they should do this, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t mean anyone would be okay with you doing it. But if you managed to, then yes, it would apparently be legal. The court can only rule on what the law actually says and it says you only have grounds to sue once you&#x27;ve suffered an actual injury, not because the party you&#x27;re trying to sue has done someone that might harm you in the future.This is frankly a shortcoming of trying to use civil law for something like this. As far as I&#x27;m aware, this is nearly always the case that you have no grounds to sue unless you&#x27;ve suffered quantifiable monetary damage from someone&#x27;s actions. If we just want this kind of thing to be generally illegal, then it needs to be made illegal according to criminal law or it needs to violate some law overseen by a government regulatory body with the power to levy its own fines. reply SoftTalker 14 hours agorootparentYes, civil law is not about deciding legality. It&#x27;s about deciding liability. And to do that, there has to be a harm demonstrated. The plaintiff could not do this, so the case was thrown out. reply SenAnder 14 hours agorootparentprev> It is legal to do this, apparentlyI am extremely skeptical of this, no matter what this judge says. This seems to be a clear case of illegal wiretapping [1]. Having an illegal act perpetrated upon one, whether it is wiretapping or assault, seems a very clear \"injury\". It is baffling that there would have to be some kind of financial price attached to be recognized as harm by a court.

The vehicle will simply think it is always out of range of cellular service. Unfortunately most modern vehicles require a lot of finagling to disable the telematics control module itself without causing error messages.It would be nice if some regulator would mandate an \"easy-off\" function for vehicle telematics - some kind of simple procedure which would remove a telematics module from the installation list and allow the module to be unplugged without triggering fault detection.

    "originBody": "Home Blog Benchmarking GPT-4 Turbo - A Cautionary Tale Nov 8, 2023 Since we first introduced Mentat, GPT-4 has been the default model. While Mentat can run with GPT-3.5 or even local models, GPT-4’s higher quality code edits are well worth the extra cost. We are excited to unlock GPT-4 Turbo's full potential — being 2-3x cheaper and having a significantly larger context — but does it match the quality of GPT-4, especially for editing code? Benchmarking GPT-4 Turbo To answer this question, we ran both GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo on our Exercism benchmarks, compiled from a set of 122 Exercism programming exercises. We got the idea to use exercism exercises from Aider and ended up using the same prompts as them to allow us to directly compare our performances. We ran GPT-4 on each task and gave it two tries to succeed (on the second attempt, it is shown why it failed). GPT-4 ended up solving 86/122, or 70%, of the JavaScript exercises. Running that same benchmark with GPT-4 Turbo we got 84/122, or 68.8% of the exercises. Slightly worse, but close enough that it could just be statistical noise. But wait! Looking closer at the results there was a significant difference: GPT-4 solved 76 on the first try and only an additional 10 on the second attempt, while GPT-4 Turbo only solved 56 on the first try and solved an additional 28 on the second attempt. Interpreting Results Why would GPT-4 Turbo solve fewer tasks on the first attempt? We examined individual exercises and the code it wrote for them and found that it often wrote reasonable solutions but failed on the first attempt due to unclear or ambiguous instructions. But then how does GPT-4 solve them? Our theory was that GPT-4 had substantially memorized the Exercism training tasks, but that when GPT-4 was downsized (most likely through distillation) to GPT-4 Turbo, it lost some of this raw memorization capability. We designed a test for this theory: we reran the benchmarks without showing the models the instructions to each exercise. Instead, we just told them that they were Exercism exercises, and gave them the exercise names and function stubs. This is not enough to solve the problem unless the model has it memorized. Due to rate limits on GPT-4 Turbo, we only ran the first 40 exercises. GPT-4 solved 23/40, or 57.5%, on the first try and an additional 5 on the second try. GPT-4 Turbo, on the other hand, only solved 12/40, or 30%, on the first try and an additional 11 on the second try. We interpret this as confirming that GPT-4 has more of the exercises memorized than GPT-4-Turbo. Our results seem similar to this finding: Although the author OCR’ed the SAT questions and believes that they weren’t in the training data, we believe it’s fairly likely that these questions – and definitely some incredibly similar questions – ended up in the training data at some point, making the drop in GPT-4 Turbo's measured performance hard to interpret. Future Benchmarks Benchmarks derived from content in GPT’s training data are still valuable for determining how good GPT is at responding in the correct edit format, as well as comparing fine-tuned models to each other. But these results make it pretty clear that they aren’t an accurate test for comparing models trained on separate datasets or distilled models – which is what we suspect GPT-4 Turbo is. These results emphasize the need for better benchmarks, something we've already begun building for Mentat: real world, realistic coding tasks based on recent commits to open source repositories that were made after the training cutoff. Although no benchmark will ever be perfect, we are confident that these improvements will help us gauge the relative accuracy of different models in the future.",

Glad to see others adopting similar benchmarking approaches.We were inspired by you to use Exercism as a benchmark, thank you! We will add attribution for that. We switched our original instruction prompts for that benchmark to be similar to Aiders to allow for fair comparison.> After looking around a bit, there seems to be a bunch of aider code in your repo. Some attribution would be appreciated.We have an unused implementation of your output response format (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AbanteAI&#x2F;mentat&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;mentat&#x2F;parsers&#x2F;...), but I don&#x27;t know what else you are seeing? We implemented that to compare with our response formats and didn&#x27;t find much difference in performance. reply anotherpaulg 17 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t spend much time looking, but your benchmark prompting inspired me to search your repo for \"aider\". The results were 3 PRs where aider was mentioned in the conversations [0].The \"code map\" PR in particular mentions being \"inspired by aider\", links to aider and seems to include a bunch of code from aider&#x27;s old ctags based \"repo map\" implementation. This isn&#x27;t an insignificant component of an AI coding tool.Aider is open source and I try and share my learnings as I&#x27;m building it. So it&#x27;s great when other projects get inspiration from aider! But it is polite to provide attribution for such inspiration, especially if you crib from code with an attribution license.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;search?q=repo%3AAbanteAI%2Fmentat+aider&t... reply throwaway675309 1 hour agoparentprevI feel like I see this A LOT these days. If you do a Show HN (for example) and your project is directly inspired by somebody else&#x27;s who came before you, the least you can do is give nominal attribution.What is it about software development in particular that makes people so seemingly ethically unfettered by blatant plagiarism? reply derwiki 19 hours agoparentprevI’ve been using the new model with Aider since it was released, and my anecdata agrees—the “edits applied successfully “ failure rate is much lower than classic gpt4.Also THANK YOU for Aider! I talk it up to all my programmer friends; it really feels like a glimpse into the future of coding. reply naiv 20 hours agoparentprevI am also noticing a massive improvement over the old model reply ja3k 17 hours agoparentprevSorry about that. We updated the blog with attribution and put an attributing comment in our code base where we use your benchmarking prompts. We&#x27;ll probably delete our implementation of your response format later today since we just had it for benchmarking. reply strich 18 hours agoparentprevDoes aider work with c# at all? reply anotherpaulg 17 hours agorootparentYes!Thanks for asking. I&#x27;ve been meaning to address these kinds of questions in the aider FAQ [0]. Here&#x27;s the entry I just added:Aider supports pretty much all the popular coding languages. This is partly because GPT-4 is fluent in most mainstream languages, and familiar with popular libraries, packages and frameworks.In fact, coding with aider is sometimes the most magical when you&#x27;re working in a language that you are less familiar with. GPT often knows the language better than you, and can generate all the boilerplate to get to the heart of your problem. GPT will often solve your problem in an elegant way using a library or package that you weren&#x27;t even aware of.Aider uses tree-sitter to do code analysis and help GPT navigate larger code bases by producing a repository map [1].Aider can currently produce repository maps for most mainstream languages, listed below. But aider should work quite well for other languages, even without repo map support. - C - C# - C++ - Emacs Lisp - Elixir - Elm - Go - Java - Javascript - OCaml - PHP - Python - QL - Ruby - Rust - Typescript[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html#what-code-languages-does-ai...[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;docs&#x2F;repomap.html reply epiccoleman 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve just started playing with aider this week, and I find it extremely fun and exciting. But I will say that I&#x27;ve had middling results with an Elixir &#x2F; Phoenix app. I don&#x27;t think this has anything to do with aider - rather, I think that the GPT models haven&#x27;t quite internalized the new approaches in Phoenix 1.7, since up until Turbo their training data was fairly old and probably still contains more pre 1.7 Phoenix examples than post 1.7.In spite of these frustrations, I have had some genuinely amazing moments coding with GPT-4 lately though. I upgraded to ChatGPT plus lately and it&#x27;s just mindblowing how helpful it can be in the right contexts. I&#x27;m hoping that as I get better with aider I might just drop the ChatGPT sub and stick to API usage.I totally understand the skepticism many have, because this stuff is still a bit finicky - but I&#x27;m overwhelmed by a sense of how fucking _cool_ this stuff is quite often. reply lemming 14 hours agorootparentprevI was actually wondering this myself yesterday. So it&#x27;s not possible to plug a different tree-sitter implementation in for a niche language? reply anotherpaulg 11 hours agorootparentIt should be possible, but not currently. Aider would need a bit more configurability to be able to load up arbitrary tree-sitter language implementations at runtime.There&#x27;s an open issue you might want to follow for updates:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paul-gauthier&#x2F;aider&#x2F;issues&#x2F;321 reply hanselot 19 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t it a good thing that of the benchmarks they ran, the newer model has fewer of the answers memorized (aka, its parroting less)?Wouldn&#x27;t this actually be exactly proof that the model has improved over its predecessor by having to solve the problem itself rather than rely on memory?What use is a model that memorizes the answers to all the benchmarks (see the 7b models on open llm leaderboard for more info on that). reply jphoward 19 hours agoprevThe problem is the discussed results are comparing proportions of a relatively small number - 67 questions. If you model this as a binomial distribution, then 62&#x2F;67 which GPT4-turbo got gives a 95% confidence interval of the &#x27;true&#x27; performance of 83.4% to 97.5%, ie it comfortably includes the proportion that GPT4 achieved (64&#x2F;67=95.5%).I think the evidence from these tests are not strong enough to draw conclusions from. reply epups 17 hours agoparentYes. I see people make this mistake time and again when evaluating LLMs. For a proper comparison, it&#x27;s not enough to simply throw less than a hundred questions at it and point to a single digit difference. Not to mention that LLMs have some inherent randomness, so even if you passed the exact same tasks to the same model you would expect some variance.I see a lot of room of improvement in how we apply statistics to understanding LLM performance. reply Maxion 14 hours agoparentprevI’m not surprised, most people can’t even tell the median from the mean. reply Racing0461 16 hours agoparentprev> I think the evidence from these tests are not strong enough to draw conclusions from.I&#x27;ve used gpt4 turbo for some coding problems yesterday. It was worse. That&#x27;s enough to draw conclusions for me. reply jessenaser 17 hours agoprevThe thing is why does the GPT-4 Turbo and the Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo have only an output of 4,096 tokens?Previous Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, 16385 tokens context and completion (shared)New Model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, 16385 tokens context, 4096 tokens completionPrevious Model: gpt-4, 8192 tokens context and completion (shared)New Model: gpt-4-1106-preview, 128000 tokens context, 4096 tokens completionWhy would the same size of a 16K GPT-3.5 model now not allow larger completion sizes?Why would the new GPT-4 reduce the completion tokens as well, gpt-4 can do 8192 and gpt-4-32k can do 32768 completion tokens. Now the limit is 4096.So you would need to change the way you prompt (split the responses) to be able to get a longer response.---So are these new models taking the old base models of 4K tokens context and completion and changing the context to 128000 but leaving the completion the same? If they could get gpt-4 to have gpt-4-8k and gpt-4-32k, why couldn&#x27;t have it been 128000 context and 32768 completion? reply srdjanr 17 hours agoparentProbably because it&#x27;s too expensive. Prompt can be processed quickly but output tokens are much slower (and that means more expensive).From my local test on a 13B model, output tokens are 20-30x more expensive than input tokens. So OpenAI&#x27;s pricing structure is based on expectation that there&#x27;s much more input than output tokens in an average response. It didn&#x27;t matter too much if a small percentage of requests used all 4k tokens for output, but with 128k it&#x27;s a different story. reply qup 15 hours agoparentprevif i&#x27;m not mistaken, the model has to be trained for a specific context window reply refulgentis 9 hours agorootparentMore or less, like there&#x27;s stuff you can do to extend the window of an existing model fairly easily, i.e. LoRA type training budget, O($1000).But in practice, even when context_size max output token count was enabled, it simply couldn&#x27;t make use of it, no matter how many prompt engineering tricks I threw at it.[1] And I&#x27;ve heard anecdotally that it&#x27;s true for that LoRA-type technique.[1] TL;DR, about 1&#x2F;5th the actual length: write 100 pages, 3 paragraphs each, number the pages as you go and write 1 page at a time until 100. Also write out \"I have written page N and need to write 100 pages total\" after each page.Inevitably it would \"get tired\" and be like \"end page 23...now page 100\" reply Racing0461 16 hours agoparentprevI believe openai wants to lower the time it takes for requests to finish to be able to accept more requests per server&#x2F;gpu. ie money. reply minihat 19 hours agoprevGPT-4 Turbo is dramatically worse at one task I often try:Read the following passage from [new ML article]. Identify their assumptions, and tell me which mathematical operations or procedures they use depend upon these assumptions.GPT-4: Usually correctly identifies the assumptions, and often quotes the correct mathematics in its reply.GPT-4 Turbo: Sometimes identifies the assumptions, and is guaranteed to stop trying at that point and then give me a Wikipedia-like summary about the assumptions rather than finish the task. Further prompting will not improve its result. reply thorax 17 hours agoparentDo you have a link or gist of an example run you tried? I&#x27;d be curious to try something similar. reply boxed 20 hours agoprev> We designed a test for this theory: we reran the benchmarks without showing the models the instructions to each exercise. Instead, we just told them that they were Exercism exercises, and gave them the exercise names and function stubs.This summarizes all my skepticism agains the AI field. Pretty clear that they aren&#x27;t solving the problem, they have them memorized. reply DecayingOrganic 20 hours agoparentMemorization often gets a bad rap as the underachiever&#x27;s shortcut. However, it&#x27;s a fundamental component of any learning process! Our ability to reason, solve problems, and innovate is all built upon a foundation of memorized information. In fact, it&#x27;s precisely the reason humans have thrived for so long; we were able to memorize and pass down knowledge culturally long before the written word, not because we were 100 times smarter than our nearest cousins. Without memorization, be it in our brains or AI algorithms, there&#x27;s no foundation to build upon for higher reasoning. reply viraptor 19 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s hard to decide for me without seeing the data. Even if you don&#x27;t know the exact exercise, seeing the title and the function name&#x2F;parameters is often enough for me to guess what the challenge is. I checked the public questions on exercism and almost all of those (that I spot checked) that contained the function name were extremely obvious. Knowing it&#x27;s a programming challenge would also improve my guessing chances.For example the function stubs I can find are \"value_of_card()\" in exercise \"Black Jack\", or \"generate_seat_letters()\" in exercise \"Plane Tickets\". I think I could guess those without seeing the rest of the question. reply drcode 17 hours agoparentprevYou can call it whatever you want, all I know is I used to write programs in lines of code, then blocks of code at a time, spit out by LLMsUsing GPT-4 Turbo yesterday, I feel like I&#x27;m moving to pages of code at a time now.Taking the ideas in my head and turning them into reality is so easy now reply rldjbpin 43 minutes agoparentprevif the benchmark means replicating the experience of taking technical interviews by most people, then this is a spot on approach and serves the potential user right. reply og_kalu 20 hours agoparentprev\"They memorized all the problems\" is not what was found here and still a wrong overcorrection. reply dartos 20 hours agorootparent“Gpt-4 has more problems memorized than gpt-4 turbo” was exactly what was found here.That doesn’t mean it’s only able to solve problems in its training set (tho it’s much better at that obviously.) reply boxed 20 hours agorootparentprevIf you are shown only the title of a coding problem and the site name where it&#x27;s from, and you manage to solve it you are showing that you either cheated or knew the answer. reply Terretta 19 hours agorootparentOn the contrary, it could mean you were, to some percentage of success, able to guess what problem is, and then, to some multiplier percentage of success, solve it.The key is, can you guess the problem from the title and the function name? I&#x27;d argue, sure, at least half the time?, why not... reply og_kalu 20 hours agorootparentprevI mean sure, it memorized some of the answers. I&#x27;m not denying that. Clearly, it didn&#x27;t memorize all of them. reply boxed 20 hours agorootparentWhen people say \"oh look how amazing, it can solve programming problems!\" when in fact it has only seen the models CHEAT, is an enormous problem.For cases where finding the answer it&#x27;s perfectly fine, but it&#x27;s not fine for claims that it can code. There&#x27;s a huge difference. reply notnaut 19 hours agorootparentIt can generate never-before-seen strings of comprehensible language. It can react to the inherent logic embedded in words and text and provide a brute forced version of what a human could. That it can “solve” a problem only through “cheating” is an anthropomorphism that betrays the magic that is evident to anyone who has used these things. reply FeepingCreature 20 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve seen it code on completely novel tasks, so I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re suggesting here.

It should have stated \"there is no actual problem to solve here, you must supply a problem for me to solve\".> It can code and it has memorized some coding questions are not mutually exclusiveThis I will give you.

Lawyers are not intelligent... reply furyofantares 18 hours agorootparentprevIt said they gave the exercise name, which doesn&#x27;t sound like just the exercise number but probably mildly descriptive -- and they also gave it function stubs. reply stnmtn 18 hours agorootparentprevIf I gave you a programming problem and all I told you was that the problem name was Traveling Salesman, you might be able to solve it based on that.If not that, then if I just said \"fizzbuzz\" to you, I&#x27;m sure you would be able to give the solution without me needing to say any other descriptions of the problem reply boxed 14 hours agorootparentAgain, because of memorization, not being able to code. reply FeepingCreature 7 hours agorootparentBut in that case, not memorization of the specific problem set, but \"programming background knowledge.\" Hardly something to blame the machine for when we rely on it every day. replyhanselot 19 hours agorootparentprevThough this is exactly what happened. The initial test was ran on a model that \"Cheated\" (aka has memorized the answers). The second test was run on a model that didn&#x27;t \"Cheat\" as much, yet still got only 2% less score. So, the question is not resolved really. How much did the first model cheat, and how much did the second? If the second model \"cheats\" less, then it wins.Also, I don&#x27;t understand your obsession with the word cheating. If you have solved a problem before on a different website and solve it again, did you cheat? Or did you just use your brain to store the solution for later? reply boxed 19 hours agorootparent> Also, I don&#x27;t understand your obsession with the word cheating.It&#x27;s all about the rule set yea. Since the rule set is not defined, technically nothing is cheating. I just interpret the rule set as \"can it code?\" and for this rule set, it seems to me that it&#x27;s cheating. reply boxed 19 hours agorootparentprev> How much did the first model cheat, and how much did the second? If the second model \"cheats\" less, then it wins.They both cheated 100%. Because they both never saw the problem. AT ALL. They just saw the title and the name of the website. replycaesil 16 hours agoparentprevIf that&#x27;s your takeaway from this then you really missed the point. The implication here is that gpt-4 to gpt-4-turbo represents a leap away from memorization and toward better reasoning with a more complete world model. reply blovescoffee 16 hours agoparentprevOk but you understand there&#x27;s a body of literature that shows that LLMs don&#x27;t \"just\" memorize reply nathanfig 16 hours agoparentprev\"memorize\" implies they can only recite things verbatim and that&#x27;s ignoring the massive leap in being able to synthesize disjoint \"memories\" in new ways. reply m3kw9 19 hours agoparentprevFrom a black box point of view and one angle, gpt is a web filter where it will try to find you the exact thing you are looking for but from memory.

Internet does not have all combinations for every possible task with any random programming language, library or constraints.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, translating natural language ideas into code is fun and all, the truth it is also code, yet in ambiguous language format given to the machine.When did natural language became better for expressing development ideas than code? I know – when you don&#x27;t know how to code in the first place. Then you will have to bet on all of the ambiguities of the language, cultural and meta-physical which words carry in order to hack your thing together instead of expressing yourself directly and explicitly.Finally what is beautiful about strict code format we are so used to - it is truly the fastest and shortest path to get your thing done, in case you possess the knowledge needed. reply doug_durham 13 hours agorootparentNatural language isn&#x27;t superior to computer languages. NL allows you to describe a software concept in a computer language and framework neutral way. The LLM generates the code. The real benefit is when you work across languages and frameworks. It is difficult to keep all of the details of all of the framework calls in your head all of the time. reply gloosx 3 hours agorootparentWhere is the evidence for that?

Effectively useless on codebases that extend beyond its fairly limited context reply ericrallen 14 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds a lot like gatekeeping.These tools will empower folks who aren’t developers to build stuff and maybe learn a bit more about how programming works.They will enable folks who have ideas, but can’t express them, to actually be able to create what they are imagining.That’s awesome.Code isn’t beautiful (except for a few rare exceptions).

The whining is just beginning. reply maciejgryka 19 hours agoprevI have similar conclusions so far. We have a custom data set (basically visual Q&A about web apps) and `gpt4` gets roughly 90% correct, while `gpt-4-1106-preview` only 86%. It&#x27;s a little noisy (I didn&#x27;t yet check out the new seeds functionality), but roughly consistent.Since I created this dataset by hand, it can&#x27;t really be memorized. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s _similar_ data in the training set, but answering correctly still requires some reasoning-like capabilities. reply msp26 19 hours agoprevI&#x27;m interested in more testing on the context side of things.For my NLP pipelines, I batch n-articles together to process (extract fields from) in one prompt (final output is something like this {\"1\":[{}], \"2\": [{},{}]...}) in one message. Compute-wise it&#x27;s inefficient but OpenAI charges by the token so it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s very reliable on gpt-4 8k.I was also pretty happy with the results on 4-turbo initially but it seems that once you go past 30k-ish tokens in context (needs way more testing), it shits itself. The indexes don&#x27;t match anymore and n_final_output is different from n_articles.Still, great model and even if the limits are lower in practice I suspect I&#x27;ll get good use out of it.Edit: With better prompting, it feels stable at n=42, ~42000 prompt tokens. reply phillipcarter 19 hours agoparentInteresting. I was skeptical about some of their claims regarding longer context, since it&#x27;s been my experience that these models just get lost after enough of it. reply msp26 19 hours agorootparentYeah, degraded performance on long contexts has been observed in plenty of other models [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2307.03172] so I was cautious too. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have access to 4-32k. I would have liked to test that out too. reply cultureswitch 17 hours agoprevEveryone who has any knowledge of machine learning knows that you don&#x27;t evaluate your model by testing it on parts of its training data.

Ironical how? replydriverdan 17 hours agoprevThis is a big problem with independent LLM testing. You need to make sure your test set isn&#x27;t included in the training set which isn&#x27;t easy with closed source models.This makes me think of how hardware manufacturers optimize for benchmarks. Closed source LLMs can intentionally include likely test data in their training set to artificially inflate results. I&#x27;m not saying they are intentionally doing that now, but they could. reply mufasachan 20 hours agoprev> Although the author OCR’ed the SAT questions and believes that they weren’t in the training dataI agree that the author of the tweet fairly underestimates the potential portion of OCR&#x27;ed contents in OpenAI&#x27;s training data. In late August, Nougat[1] is released by Meta, this is an OCR model. Its performance are wild and the model is open source.I hardly believe that OpenAI does not spend effort on getting more training from OCR content. I also hardly believes that OpenAI waits for a Meta paper to have an internal performant OCR model.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2308.13418 reply Satam 18 hours agoprevVery interesting and basically confirms that GPT-4 turbo is a faster but dumber model. When a task doesn&#x27;t rely on memorization of the training set, it reasons similarly well to GPT-4. Where memorization is helpful, it performs worse (due to quantization-induced \"memory loss\").This also makes me look at GPT-4 as a \"weak reasoner with a lot of knowledge\". That really aligns with my experience where it is immensely helpful and has a superhuman knowledge base but still needs handholding to solve real problems. reply mccrory 20 hours agoprevGPT -4 Turbo is still in preview, maybe wait until it is fully released before judging? reply msp26 19 hours agoparentThe point of a preview phase is to test the model in real world use. reply seanhunter 18 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t really real-world use any more than putting these same problems to people as a whiteboard coding exercise in an interview is real-world coding, yet seemingly a lot of people seem to be generalising from this tiny sample to all manner of overarching statements about performance of the model in general \"it&#x27;s faster but dumber\", \"this proves it only memorises\" etc. reply maxrmk 15 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve always been skeptical of benchmarking because of the memorization problem.

IMO for a proper benchmark you should ask it the same question 10+ times and show a confidence interval, otherwise you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just a fluke or a lucky guess. reply maxrmk 15 hours agorootparentAhh good suggestion, I should clarify this in the article. I tried to compensate with volume -- I used a set of 200 questions for the testing. I was using temperature 0, so I&#x27;d get the same answer if I ran a single question multiple times. reply m3kw9 19 hours agoprevNow do a programming task that requires more than 32k of context and see who’s “better”. If you don’t bench mark that you cannot get an overall pic. GitHub copilot for example could benefit big from the increased context reply broast 19 hours agoparentObviously it&#x27;s a drawback but the silver lining of the small context window is it forces me to decouple everything and have very sensible and strict api&#x27;s where I just write the docs and it writes the code. reply biobootloader 17 hours agoparentprevwe are working on creating \"real world\" benchmarks that require a lot of context, and will report when we have results! reply og_kalu 19 hours agoprevI think it&#x27;s interesting that forcing models out of memorization don&#x27;t always show a steep drop in ability.I&#x27;ve definitely had instances where 4 memorized a common puzzle and failed a subtly altered variant but then got the variant after changing variable names or otherwise making it look different from what it would have memorized. reply m3kw9 19 hours agoprevThat’s why is called 4 turbo, not “4.5”.

If it was guessing based on function stubs, the prediction would be that correct answers would be clustered around the beginner exercises, and that as the exercises advanced in difficulty, there were fewer correct answers. reply sunpazed 20 hours agoprevThis reflects my anecdotal findings in a very narrow domain: GPT-4 consistently resolves complex SQL from natural language, whereas GPT-4-Turbo is hit-and-miss, and similar to 3.5-Turbo in performance. reply Semaphor 20 hours agoparentBut that’s not what the article is saying at all? reply Havoc 19 hours agoprevIs it know what exactly OpenAI does in the background when they make these turbo editions?Seems like sacrificing some quality for large gains on speed and cost but anyone know more detail? reply thorax 17 hours agoparentDon&#x27;t think so, but there were some guesses on 3.5-turbo-- i.e. training a much smaller model on quality questions&#x2F;answers from GPT-4.

    "originBody": "Typing Fast Is About Latency, Not Throughput by kqr , published 2023-11-06 Tags: meta_programming technology A common misconception in discussions about typing speed is that any speed above, say, maybe 80 wpm, isn’t going to hinder anyone when trying to put anything into the computer This particular version comes from an article that’s really about something else, but I’ve heard it in almost every discussion. Let’s examine it. To be clear, at a steady state in a mature project, I get something like 125 lines of code into production per week. If a line of code corresponds to something like 10 words, and we divide that by my 35-hour work week11 Bless Sweden and their generous culture around parental leave., it would seem like I can type only one word per minute and still get my job done. But the problem isn’t throughput. If throughput was the concern, most professionals could get by with far less than 80 words per minute. Even writers who work in their natural language struggle with producing more than a few pages per day; counting charitably, that’s less than 5 words per minute. Throughput is not the issue. Latency is. What can we do when we are able to type faster? Someone writing prose can try multiple ways of shaping their sentences and see how the sentences interact with each other. When I write articles for this site, I’m sure I produce well over 5× the content that ends up in the final article, re-writing and re-structuring and deleting things continuously. This happens very quickly, and I don’t do it when I write on a touchscreen or with pen-and-paper, because I write too slowly on those media. Fast typing unlocks this technique. Someone writing code can think of how to structure the code, then put it down into code and very quickly move on to think about the next thing. It’s difficult to type and think at the same time, so any time spent writing is a pause in thoughts, which can derail the flow. When I write code on a touchscreen or a small keyboard, I find it harder to keep track of where I’m going next, because it takes so damn long to get a line of code out of my head and onto the screen. You can argue that someone writing at 80 words per minute can get a line of code down in 8 seconds, and learning to write at 120 words per minute will improve this by a mere three seconds, so what’s the big deal? I don’t have any science to point to, but imagine being forced to sit and do nothing (not even think!) for three seconds after every five seconds of typing. That would drive me up the wall!

But if one of my jr teammates are typing out every single character of their code I will slap their ass and teach them about autocomplete and github copilot. So much faster to have jr type their code (as in define the types) and leave the typing (as in the writing) to the editor.That still doesn&#x27;t stop us from having typing (as in writing) races at the office which is a fun thing. reply vishnugupta 1 hour agoparentprev> The main positive that I see is that typing no longer requires thought.I can&#x27;t emphasise this enough.Whenever I see even experienced programmers searching for the right keys or trying to correct their mistakes I just feel sad for all the lost productivity. It&#x27;s also about not using the subconscious muscle memory which means a good chunk of conscious mental bandwidth is getting wasted on repeated task that could otherwise have been used for programming&#x2F;creativity etc.,By a sequence of happy coincidences I got trained as a touch typist before I could go anywhere near a computer. On a real mechanical typewriter. So by the time I was learning programming I was focused solely on learning it as opposed to fighting the keyboard. The benefit of touch-typing can&#x27;t be emphasised enough, if it were up to me I&#x27;d make touch typing a mandatory skill training course. reply lanstin 8 hours agoparentprevBefore I was able to get a job with computers, I had jobs as typists. I had one job typing (on paper with a typewriter) trust documents for banks. You had to produce the entire page without any errors, no whiteout or the ink-lifting correction stuff.It was more discipline than other typing jobs, but paid off. I also never think about typing unless I&#x27;m having to recreate emacs or vi commands on a weird touch-screen keyboard or that time I learned Dvorak for a while. reply brantonb 3 hours agoparentprevIn high school, I took two semesters of typing on typewriters. For our tests, Mrs. Beck would take the correction ribbons out. There was no point in trying to fix anything, keep going as fast as possible.We went to a tri-county competition that used computers instead. I was the only one from my school that realized we could correct our mistakes during the competition. I sacrificed a bit of speed to get 100% accuracy and won the whole shebang. Mistakes were heavily penalized in the scoring. reply eichin 7 hours agoparentprevYeah, if the system I&#x27;m using has excessive latency (more of a 90s problem than today) precision means even when I do mistype, I&#x27;m \"feeling\" it and backspacing, not seeing them (since they haven&#x27;t echoed yet.)It&#x27;s definitely about getting to the point where you&#x27;re not thinking about typing, you&#x27;re thinking about words&#x2F;sentences&#x2F;lines of code (or higher.)I particularly noticed this when going from perl to python - in perl you were typing fewer characters, in python you could use more mainline english typing and not care that you were using more keystrokes... reply treyd 4 hours agorootparent> if the system I&#x27;m using has excessive latency (more of a 90s problem than today) precision means even when I do mistype, I&#x27;m \"feeling\" it and backspacing, not seeing them (since they haven&#x27;t echoed yet.)Perhaps I&#x27;m just overly sensitive but if the input latency from keypress to echoing is consciously perceptible then I consider that already unusably slow. I can&#x27;t imagine using a setup like that regularly.

I have better accuracy this way reply aragonite 6 hours agoparentprevAs someone who has 100% accuracy, how do you avoid the kind of typos that result from incorrect finger synchronization, like &#x27;teh&#x27;?These synchronization errors have been the main source of my typos, unlike the kind of typo caused by individual finger imprecision, like accidentally hitting &#x27;p&#x27; when meaning to type &#x27;o&#x27;.It occurs to me that because we use both hands, the way we type is inherently &#x27;asynchronous&#x27;. For example, when trying to type(&#x27;the&#x27;), the individual &#x27;function calls&#x27;, typechar(&#x27;t&#x27;), typechar(&#x27;h&#x27;), typechar(&#x27;e&#x27;) may be initiated (i.e. fingers begin moving towards their target keys) in that order, but there&#x27;s no guarantee they are terminated (i.e. fingers hitting their target keys) in that order, because typechar(&#x27;h&#x27;) is performed with the right hand whereas typechar(&#x27;e&#x27;) is performed with left, so typechar(&#x27;h&#x27;) cannot \"block\" on typechar(&#x27;e&#x27;).But if we were to make each typechar action wait for the previous one, it would be unacceptably slow as well. So it seems the only solution is to invest time in developing just the right muscle memory where everything is timed perfectly. reply dharmab 6 hours agorootparentHow does a pianist hit the keys in the right order?

Having a steady hand helps tremendously with that IME. I noticed e.g. when I quit drinking (even occasionally) that I got way better at this. While typing, I also started stumbling way less over complicated words at that time.Practice did help too, but tbh, I practiced a _lot_ and it was frustrating seeing other players be so much more accurate than me while I had likely practiced just as much. Being healthy is just a competitive advantage. reply silisili 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is something that&#x27;s bitten me as I&#x27;ve gotten older.

Once typing happens automatically, your focus improves. reply rconti 3 hours agoparentprevThe accuracy argument gives me flashbacks to the days of talk&#x2F;ntalk&#x2F;whatever conversations as a teenager, over 2400bps modems, cross country. I distinctly remember realizing I made a typo 3 words ago, while the cursor was several lines up, and being able to quickly backspace, fix it, and continue typing. It was so satisfying to finish my thought, and then watch as the cursor spewed out the words, the typo, go back, correct the typo, and continue on perfectly.

The words just appeared on the page. And if you were over his shoulder, his accuracy didn&#x27;t decrease that much.

I slow down to a crawl typing random strings of characters or new words&#x2F;names because I don&#x27;t actually know how to touch type I think. I just know what finger movements produce a word. It&#x27;s kind of like how you don&#x27;t think about how to ride a bike. It&#x27;s just something you do in the same way that you don&#x27;t manually breath although you could.Typing correctly when someone is watching us more about not not letting someone&#x27;s possible judgment distract you.

Spent a while trying to zone out and let the muscle memory take over again but didn&#x27;t work and finally gave up and asked for it to be reset.Very strange experience.... reply kqr 1 hour agorootparentprevRelatedly, I type both sides of matching pairs (parens, quotes, braces, etc.) and then left-arrow back into them to fill them with content. This is convenient to keep them balanced and because they are awkward to produce so I might as well do both in one motion.When people see it they sometimes ask me what keyboard shortcut that was, but no, I just typed them and backed into them. reply kccqzy 6 hours agorootparentprevI feel this for my passwords.

Do you have this as well? reply corytheboyd 7 hours agorootparentprevOh yeah I can agree with the muscle memory of it. I often cannot remember little nuances of syntax when instructing others what to type, but it just comes out if I’m typing it. I often have to go start typing it in a scratch pad to double check myself hah!I also realize how much of what I use all the time is actually “ctrl-r ” and have to go double check that when working with others.

I don&#x27;t touch type properly, don&#x27;t use home row, but type at a pretty decent clip when it&#x27;s familiar - even code. Slow down quite a bit in new territory.What sometimes gets me though - I think one word, but type another. It&#x27;s almost always the same starting letter or letters though. It&#x27;s like the muscle memory kicks in, but takes the wrong fork in the road or something. Very odd. reply corytheboyd 7 hours agorootparentThis happens to me all the time! “Thought” instead of “though” comes up often, but I know I’ll just type in completely different words than I meant to as well. I am always reading back anything I send a minute later, just to catch the silly mistakes and correct them. It is probably annoying for the people reading the newly-sent message, when it shifts around while they are reading it. Sorry! replyyashap 5 hours agoprevNot the core point of the article, but …> To be clear, at a steady state in a mature project, I get something like 125 lines of code into production per week.I don’t think this is uncommon, but it’s wild to me that so many companies let their dev productivity degrade to this level. I work at a decent sized startup, 8 years old, fairly large codebase, and even junior devs who are pretty new to the company are averaging a couple hundred LOC&#x2F;week shipped to prod, while the most productive devs are averaging ~1K LOC&#x2F;week.We spend plenty of time keeping the dev env fast, keeping CI (build, test and deploy) fast, minimizing risk even with minimal QA (strong test coverage, canary deploys with auto-rollback, strong alerting), and refactoring to reduce complexity. But even still, ~60% of overall dev time is spent on product stuff, and this other ~40% is SO worth it if it keeps devs ~10x as productive.An environment where even strong devs only average ~125 LOC&#x2F;week is just so, so unproductive, it’s crazy to me that companies let this become the norm. Prior to my current company (which I would consider very high productivity), I worked at a place where the productivity was more inline with 125 LOC&#x2F;week (experienced, fully on-boarded devs were around 200 I’d guess), I can see how this happens, but it’s crazy to me that so many companies LET it happen. reply viraptor 4 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s a level of mature projects where you don&#x27;t really do new features anymore. There&#x27;s polish and some changes and focusing on more reliability instead. And in those cases, you need lots more testing and validation and not much stupid code. I had one leg in development and one in operations and had weeks where I merged 10 lines of change - and they were properly tested and important 10 lines and that was how long they needed take. LOC is a silly metric - don&#x27;t let it become your dick measuring contest or expect it to correlate with level and you&#x27;ll learn to appreciate the small, difficult changes too.

There&#x27;s a massive amount of space in between \"done\" and startup level expansion. There are good, mature projects which need some improvements and TLC, without expanding their scope every day.And because they&#x27;re already large and most of the simple issues have been addressed, you start getting the interesting problems that take many more times as long to investigate and understand as they take to fix. reply yashap 4 hours agorootparentEh, a lot of the biggest, most successful&#x2F;profitable tech companies are still rapidly developing new products, features, etc. For example, Google, Amazon and Apple are all still innovating pretty fast.Lots of others have basically stopped shipping new products, new features, performance improvements, UX improvements, etc. But I think that’s frequently an undesirable state the company has gotten into, they’d love to be productive but have lost the ability. reply viraptor 4 hours agorootparent> For example, Google, Amazon and Apple are all still innovating pretty fast.I&#x27;d dispute that in general. And definitely if you mean amount of innovation per employee. They try random new things that either lives in its little corner, or gets killed in a couple of years. They sure have lots of churn and likely lots of lines of code flying around, but innovation...? There&#x27;s two projects from Apple from the last decade that I&#x27;d call innovation.

There, the point is that anything that causes you to context shift is bad. The feedback loop of code&#x2F;test&#x2F;break&#x2F;fix is everything.But I think after reading that the argument was more akin to webpage load times. Sure, a few extra seconds isn&#x27;t measurably a lot, but there&#x27;s a feeling of responsiveness that matters to our psyche, even if according to wall time it&#x27;s not a big deal. This I find more plausible. I&#x27;ve seen code. I know how damn lazy we can be. People seem to be willing to spend hours of pain to avoid writing tiny helper structs, or writing helper methods, or giving functions&#x2F;variables names with multiple words.Still, 80 wpm seems like a lot off hand. That&#x27;s coming up on regular speaking speed. I wonder if I could test the difference on myself to see if it bothered me; maybe add something that slows my typing rate to 80? reply sebastiennight 7 hours agoparentI regularly use teleprompters and therefore know my speech rate and it&#x27;s in the 200-220 wpm range.Someone speaking at 80 words per minute would sound drunk to me. Or like the super. dynamic. guy. in. the. Ai. Pin. demo. reply tommychillfiger 8 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m a pretty fast typist (also guitarist - maybe related?), and I did a speed test with my coworkers for shits and giggles not long ago. I got 110wpm with 100% accuracy although it was a fairly simple prompt. Some semicolons, commas, and quotations, but nothing crazy. I would definitely say it feels like I am typing nearly (but not quite) as fast as most people speak. The benefit for me is honestly handicapped by the fact that most people can&#x27;t type that fast so I don&#x27;t save any time when actually communicating with others since I have to wait for their response either way.That being said, I don&#x27;t think I would code anywhere near that fast. Maybe years later when I&#x27;m far better at it than I am now. I probably type around 60-70wpm if I&#x27;m writing some basic SQL where I know what I&#x27;m looking for, I would guess.When I was in college, it definitely was helpful being able to type quickly so that I could workshop ideas and phrase structures in papers more or less in real time. I honestly almost never wrote drafts, I&#x27;d just revise as I went along in that fashion. reply codefined 9 hours agoparentprevMost people typically speak in the 130 - 180 word per minute range, although this can vastly change based on context. Preprepared speeches, arguments and monologues generally have a higher pace than a usual conversation between two people. reply userbinator 9 hours agoprevWith far more people doing remote work now than pre-2020, IM is another way in which typing speed is very important for productivity, and this likely has a teamwide effect too --- if most of your team can type nearly at the speed of thought, then everyone waiting for the slowest member to share his thoughts on some discussion gets irritating rather quickly.Yes, I know there are audio calls, but with IM it&#x27;s much easier to be doing more than one thing at once, and talking into each other isn&#x27;t a problem. reply Etheryte 8 hours agoparentNot to sound rude, but that&#x27;s an incredibly obnoxious take.

Many people prefer text even for live back-and-forth conversations in order to avoid the overhead of voice&#x2F;video for a variety of reasons, such as being in a noisy location, having slow internet, carrying multiple conversations, skipping the overhead of greetings&#x2F;equipment setup.All email is asynchronous, and some instant messaging channels can be treated asynchronously, but some of it is definitely live. If you are not treating some conversations that way, it is you who is being rude and forcing the way you like to communicate onto others. reply LoganDark 4 hours agorootparent> Many people prefer text even for live back-and-forth conversationsHi, this is me.

This is WAY faster than I can talk.But I don&#x27;t think this typing speed provides me the advantages the article professes - as others have noted, I am much more gated by the time I spend thinking before typing than I am the typing process itself. Dropping to 80wpm is going to influence the amount of garbage I throw out arguing with people on the internet far more than it would doing anything actually productive.To the point of having to pause thought while typing, I don&#x27;t find this to be particularly true. I&#x27;ll still be thinking of how exactly I want to word something as I&#x27;m typing it, and will make minor adjustments on the fly. reply callalex 8 hours agorootparentprevI have a tendency to stumble over my words or forget what I was saying mid-sentence (yay ADHD). Once you have to move the cursor backwards, typing will always be faster than speaking. reply mewpmewp2 8 hours agorootparentprevHmm, it&#x27;s easier for me to type than to talk I think. Talking requires more focus. reply RheingoldRiver 5 hours agorootparentyes, same. And the more time passes, the more this skews. My thoughts flow naturally into words when I&#x27;m typing, but if I have to speak them I forget what words I want to use very easily, and sometimes I&#x27;ll have to pause for several seconds to recall what I want to say. It almost feels like spoken English isn&#x27;t my native language anymore, and typing is. reply LoganDark 4 hours agorootparentprevI find that my typing is much better because I can constantly re-parse the sentence as I am writing it.

Typing fast won&#x27;t help when you&#x27;re stepping through the code one line at a time, and it won&#x27;t help when you&#x27;re just sitting there with your eyes closed at your desk waiting to find out what to do next.

This became much easier than earlier.So I&#x27;d agree, that you may write down things quickly or write a lot more in a minute. For coding this means you easily write comments, for messages or articles means you can write a lot more in one moment, which means you write a lot more elaborately. reply kazinator 9 hours agoprevWhen you say \"Doing X fast is about Y\" it means that Y is the key to doing X fast.The headline here is misleading; it&#x27;s supposed to be \"The Benefit of Typing Fast is the reduced Latency, not the Throughput\".If you wanted high throughput, what you could do is type at 20 wpm, and do so continuously all day without taking a break: minute after minute, cranking out twenty new words.Your daily throughput would be higher than that of many a 160 wpm typist who only wields that skill in short bursts throughout the day.The benefit of typing fast is that in those moments when you need something banged up, you see the result faster: the latency from starting to type to completing the intended change is lower with faster typing. reply lordwiz 4 hours agoprevI agree that latency is important, the way in which you can type out things without spending extra time in delays can be a huge productivity boost,One sort of analogy we can give is driving a car with good response time, even if the car is not having a good top speed, the acceleration we get when we push the pedal is enough to think we are going fast.But throughput can also have a dominating factor, but its reliant on other areas, like typing out an already prepared article.For operations that require thought, latency is important reply mistercow 8 hours agoprevI love it when there’s a blogpost I’ve been meaning to write for years, and someone else comes along and does a good job writing up the same point, and with better framing. reply ceeam 2 hours agoprevWhy don&#x27;t the schools, regular ones, teach proper ten finger touch typing?
