    "originBody": "Writing GNOME Apps with Swift March 25, 2024 david-swift David is a student interested in Swift and the GNOME Project. Swift is well-suited for creating user interfaces thanks to the clean syntax, static typing, and special features making code easier to write. Result builders, combined with Swift’s closure expression syntax, can significantly enhance code readability. Adwaita for Swift leverages these Swift features to provide an intuitive interface for developing applications for the GNOME platform. GNOME is a popular, open source desktop environment for Linux, known for its emphasis on simplicity and accessibility. It offers an intuitive user interface, with a vast app ecosystem built using its modern Adwaita design language. Explore a collection of great apps under Apps for GNOME. Let’s look at a code example of using Adwaita for Swift. The following code snippet defines a view, which represents a part of the user interface inside a window. struct Counter: View { @State private var count = 0 var view: Body { HStack { Button(icon: .default(icon: .goPrevious)) { count -= 1 } Text(\"\\(count)\") .style(\"title-1\") .frame(minWidth: 100) Button(icon: .default(icon: .goNext)) { count += 1 } } } } A view can be nested within other views or added as the child of a window. Its content can be modified from outside that view and is influenced by its position in the view hierarchy. This makes it easier to compose views to produce different results. The screenshot shows one simple possibility. Motivation The primary motivation for this package is to enable the use of Swift when writing GNOME apps, for all the reasons outlined above. But there are a few additional reasons: Declarative While there are already libadwaita and GTK bindings for numerous modern programming languages, including Rust, Python, and JavaScript, all official bindings follow an imperative coding style. This can be verbose and harder to follow than a declarative style as user interfaces are constructed using a series of commands. The following Python code serves as an illustration of this. class Counter(Gtk.Box): def __init__(self): Gtk.Box.__init__(self, orientation=Gtk.Orientation.HORIZONTAL, spacing=6) self.count = 0 button_prev = Gtk.Button.new_from_icon_name(\"go-previous\", Gtk.IconSize.BUTTON) button_prev.connect(\"clicked\", self.on_prev_clicked) self.pack_start(button_prev, True, True, 0) self.label = Gtk.Label(label=str(self.count)) self.label.set_name(\"title-1\") self.pack_start(self.label, True, True, 0) button_next = Gtk.Button.new_from_icon_name(\"go-next\", Gtk.IconSize.BUTTON) button_next.connect(\"clicked\", self.on_next_clicked) self.pack_start(button_next, True, True, 0) def on_prev_clicked(self, button): self.count -= 1 self.label.set_text(str(self.count)) def on_next_clicked(self, button): self.count += 1 self.label.set_text(str(self.count)) This Python code uses the PyGObject library and produces the same user interface as the Swift code above. Ease of Use As you can see, Adwaita for Swift is built around data. For example, changing the variable count when pressing one of the buttons in the sample app will automatically update the user interface. Traditional bindings require you to call a function on the object holding a widget that should update its content once a value changes. If you decide to store the value on the disk so that it persists between startups of the app, you would have to add a lot of complexity to your code using traditional bindings. Adwaita for Swift enables you to simply add a unique identifier to the variable that should be stored, and will take care of the rest. @State(\"count\") private var count = 0 There is also a simple and safe approach for localization with the Localized package. Readability The simplicity coming with the data-centric approach has a positive impact on readability. Another point is the declarative definition of the user interface itself. You can focus on what the app should look like and how it should behave rather than how to achieve those results. While there are other solutions available, such as defining the UI with XML and Blueprint, they require the user interface and actual code to be written in different files. Also, updating the user interface has to be done manually whenever data changes. This makes it more difficult to follow the logic as a reader. As the user interface is written in Swift, you can use convenient Swift syntax directly in your user interface definition. var view: Body { if count == 0 { Text(\"😍\") } else { Text(\"\\(count)\") } } Cross-Platform App Development Adwaita for Swift is useful in a number of ways: You can write apps that run on Linux, macOS and Windows with a single codebase. You can share backend Swift code between SwiftUI apps and GNOME apps. You can create entirely new GNOME apps using Swift, achieving great code readability and memory safety. Publish Apps In addition to traditional distribution packages, Adwaita for Swift works great with Flathub. Flathub is an app store powered by Flatpak which simplifies the installation and publishing of apps for desktop Linux. There is the Freedesktop SDK Extension for Swift 5 which adds support for Swift, and a tool to convert Swift Package Manager dependencies into Flatpak sources. Learn how to publish your apps in the Adwaita for Swift documentation. Get Involved Each contribution to this project is highly appreciated. You can: Create an app! Use the template repository as a starting point and refer to the tutorial. Feel free to showcase your project in the discussions. Note that libadwaita works best on Linux. If you’re on a newer Mac and interested in Linux, check out Asahi Linux. Open issues if you find any problems or if you have an idea, or participate in the dicussions by asking questions, dicussing ideas, or informing others about your work. Write documentation to help others understand Adwaita for Swift. Simply star the repository to improve its discoverability. Take a look at the Memorize app. It is the first app on Flathub built using Adwaita for Swift.

The key premise of this approach is to provide a SwiftUI-like declarative wrapper around Gnome functionality. It's unclear what it adds over swift-cross-ui. SwiftUI itself has growing pains mainly around being on the right thread for processing/updates and getting data binding right. Blog entries on swift.org or from Apple tend to be little demos that show the happy path, but when discussing new frameworks (like a Gnome wrapper) or platforms (like the recent embedded), I'd like more demonstration that the authors understand and address key issues and will sustain development. Cross-platform UI frameworks get complicated quickly and have a long tail of issues (cf Flutter, Java/Eclipse, et al) that can be blockers for clients/users. For Swift it doesn't help to have multiple concurrency models and obviously different behaviors on apple platforms and Linux (where UI is not officially tested). reply azinman2 17 hours agoparentI’ve never struggled with being on the right thread. It’s always main to update UI. Grand dispatch makes this trivial, and the recent actors work also extends this. I’m also not sure how this is SwiftUI specific as UIKit and most other UI frameworks are the same. What are the growing pains here? reply brailsafe 1 hour agorootparentWell, I've been fighting with an extremely simple Navigationsplitview for ages. Put a list in the sidebar, put 100 items in it, and render almost anything else in the detail on macos (one version back). Then select an item in the nav and hit the down arrow. Depending on implementation, scrolling will get clipped to the visible area, it'll hold onto multiple selections if the first has been scrolled off screen, or the main thread will get thrashed and performance will be about what the current settings menu is. I haven't found something that I don't have to accept a really mediocre experience with, but next I'm going to try rewriting it with NSTable reply w10-1 17 hours agorootparentprevAside from UI updates, processing includes view-model derivations (e.g., calculating errors), persistence, and loading, all of which are offloaded to dispatch queues or actors and then brought back to the UI/main thread. wrt granularity, there's @State, @StateObject, and @Observable, with different binding reaches. So understandably a lot of choices reflecting legacy and new API's, integration with UIKit and web/media services -- and probably AI recognizers in the background. To me the pains are that the approach taken needs to be consistent application-wide (async is pretty viral, queues are designed to be shared e.g., per subsystem, etc.), making it hard to manage or migrate a code base. Also many features build on macros which can make builds almost intolerable. Also saving on macOS vs integrating with update manager on iOS. It can be hard even to find documentation on stdlib feature support e.g., Regex. It's good they maintain both the legacy support and go full-steam-ahead on new features, but developers (i.e., I) need more guidance on tip-toeing around pitfalls and managing platform differences. reply nickwarren 8 hours agoprevSwift is such a delightful language to use, well suited for general application development. It's awesome to see it gaining traction outside of the cocoa ecosystem. If you haven't given it a fair chance yet, I would highly recommend you do! reply zengid 5 hours agoprevI feel like a cross platform Swift GUI would be a great thing for the world. Swift strikes a great balance between ergonomics and performance, and seems to be the only other mainstream language to have absorbed some of Rust's key features around borrowing references. reply georgelyon 3 hours agoparentFor the record, borrowed references are only going to be really usable in Swift 6 which isn't released yet. That said, Swift's implementation of borrowing seems significantly more user-friendly than Rust's. While this is very much an advanced feature, I'd expect it to be actually used in many cases where in Rust folks would resort to working around the borrow checking (via things like indexing into arrays and such). As a result I expect it to be significantly more useful. reply jrsj 3 hours agoparentprevBrowser Company sort of built this themselves for Arc, but its really a separate SwiftUI-like Windows implementation (Windows UI is separate code written in a similar style). It still feels like a technical preview though unfortunately. reply lukeh 20 hours agoprevOther things worth checking: https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak I’m also working (slowly) on native Flutter channels: https://github.com/PADL/FlutterSwift But this is really targeted at embedded use cases. reply dkh 19 hours agoparentTIL Sony maintains a Flutter eLinux embedder project[0] [0] https://github.com/sony/flutter-embedded-linux reply marcprux 18 hours agoparentprevAnd there's also SwiftUI for Android: https://skip.tools/blog/bringing-swift-to-android/ reply jwells89 16 hours agorootparentWill have to try it to see how well it works in practice, but very cool.

Delphi had it right - place whatever controls you like in a GUI, set up basic behavior via properties, then just quickly write handlers in code. reply ptx 8 hours agoparentPerhaps, but as a counterexample, the SerenityOS people implemented the Delphi approach with Visual Builder but then realized that they preferred working with text, so they replaced it with a declarative DSL and live preview (GML Playground). Here's Andreas Kling briefly demoing both and talking a bit about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QYBvTy9QKE&t=519s reply badsectoracula 8 hours agorootparentI don't know about Visual Builder, but judging from this screenshot[0] it doesn't look like the Delphi approach, but the \"Windows resource editor\" approach. Yes, both allow you to place things visually, but one works with live instances of serialized objects in an IDE that also understands the edited source code and can modify the code to -e.g.- introduce a new event handler for the OnClick event when you doubleclick the button (even with the cursor placed just right where you can start writing the actual logic of the event handling code), while the other has you draw the UI, assign some IDs and then expects you to do all the plumbing of loading the UI, associating it with code and handlers by hand. The difference might sound trivial but in practice it is like trying to dismiss editing text with Emacs by experiencing editing text in Notepad. [0] https://adkaster.github.io/images/build/VisualBuilder.png reply fleabitdev 11 hours agoparentprevI also admire the simplicity of this approach, but it has several downsides: - Code-based UIs tend to work better with existing tooling, like comments and source control. You can freely customise your development environment, rather than being at the mercy of a single GUI app. - Most serious UIs need code-like features, such as \"for-each\" to render a list of objects, or \"if\" to reveal a form when a checkbox is ticked. The easiest way to access code-like features is to write your UIs in code. - You'll need to write some backing code in any case. Defining the UI tree and its \"code-behind\" in the same file could be considered more DRY. - Live preview (or alternatively, hot reloading) will give you very quick iteration when writing a UI in code. It's not quite as good as drag-to-resize, but it's close. - Automatic layout (which is non-optional nowadays) isn't necessarily a great fit for WYSIWYG editing. - As React has demonstrated, the ability to quickly throw together custom components is extremely useful. Visual editors tend to make it more complicated and bureaucratic to define custom components. reply jwells89 5 hours agorootparentIn addition: - WYSIWYG editors are bad about making small unintended changes that can easily slip by undetected (Interface Builder in Xcode for example often changes XIBs/storyboards just by viewing them) - WYSIWYG editors bury bits of configuration in inspectors that are only visible in certain conditions, e.g. a control being selected, making them less evident and more difficult to find There are circumstances where I think they still work alright — for instance I still enjoy building Mac apps with XIBs in Cocoa, but there’s a reason for that: traditional desktop UI has much less of a need for flexibility and generally speaking, has far fewer moving parts since it doesn’t have to hide things as a result of limited screen real estate. Additionally, these apps will only ever run on Macs which further reduces need for flexibility/adaptivity. For mobile and multiplatform on the other hand, I strongly prefer code. It just works better. reply berkes 12 hours agoparentprevMy immediate though of the Swift Example Code was \"but where does the business logic go\". This trivial example lacks it, and places it simple logic inside the UI code. But what if we want to protect against negative numbers? Or want to increase the number with larger increments if we hold the button pressed? Etc. Your Delphi setup isolates business logic from UI. Which may seem \"overly complex\" in trivial demoes, but will help you the very moment you write the first test or add some business logic. It's also why I see so many React apps spiral into an unmaintainable mess within days after their \"git init\". reply NiteOwl066 11 hours agorootparentYou would just use some architecture pattern. I would say the most natural one for SwiftUI is MVVM so the logic would go to viewModel. reply berkes 5 hours agorootparentDo I understand it correct when the UI then calls methods or functions on a model layer? reply Wytwwww 11 hours agorootparentprev> Your Delphi setup isolates business logic from UI. Which may seem \"overly complex\" in trivial demoes, but will help you the very moment you write the first test or add some business logic. So basically, the same as Cocoa/obj-C? reply diggan 11 hours agorootparentprev> It's also why I see so many React apps spiral into an unmaintainable mess within days after their \"git init\". This is true for any library/framework/architecture, and the same problem is very prominent in Svelte/Vue/React/Backbone/Angular and everything else. reply berkes 8 hours agorootparent> and everything else. No. It's true for any library or framework that lack isolation or decoupling concepts. In react (and many of the ones you mention) there is nothing on place that guides you into decoupling. It has nothing, not even conventions, that help a junior to put stuff in the right place (or to prohibit or make it difficult to put stuff in the wrong place). Part of that is due to how in TS/JS everything can grope around in everything else. But the bigger part is lacking conventions, primitives and structure in the libs and frameworks. Sure, a library (which react is) doesn't provide structure (it's a distinguishing trait from frameworks). But the many frameworks on top of React don't do a good job either. They either become some Enterprise Ready amalgamation of saga's, redux, message-bus, setups, or they offer too little guidance. And in all situations, it's still possible to just fire a fetch() or put data transforms or business logic within the UI. Only discipline keeps people from taking this \"much easier\" route. And when only discipline stands between us and \"the easier way for now\", that \"easier way for now\" will be chosen, and pain in future will be felt. reply imbnwa 6 hours agorootparent>They either become some Enterprise Ready amalgamation of saga's, redux, message-bus, setups, or they offer too little guidance At least Redux provides a semblance of immediately grokable data flow, this all gets worse with mobx which gives you all the flour you need to make spaghetti for the whole village. Worked on a codebase where you might have to chase down references across all sorts of files you wouldn't expect because everything is 'observable' so people, working 2-week sprints, just stop thinking about any kind of coherent structure cause it works anyway. reply teekert 11 hours agoparentprevBut then what if the UI changes dimensions? Then you'd need an underlying set of rules, and isn't it best if you can set those rules yourself? How would that work graphically? And then how about version control? Sure there could be (and is) underlying machine code, and you could try hard to make it human readable. But... IDK seems like a lot of effort to me for some small benefits. Disclaimer: I have only very little experience with UI programming. reply badsectoracula 11 hours agorootparent> But then what if the UI changes dimensions? Then you'd need an underlying set of rules, and isn't it best if you can set those rules yourself? How would that work graphically? I don't know about current Delphi, but in Lazarus (which is kind of an open source and crossplatform Delphi) you set those rules visually. For example you can \"draw\" the UI by drag-and-dropping controls in a window/containers/etc and then you can add rules like \"this button's left side will be 5 pixels from that label's left side and will be placed vertically so that it is centered relatively to the label\". You can also set things like \"this control (or container or whatever) will always be at the top/left/right/bottom edge of its window/container\". This is done in the visual editor with immediate feedback (you can even resize the window/container while you are editing its layout to see how it behaves). This allows you to make UIs that work not only across dimensions, but also handle different fonts, texts (for localization), scaling (for DPI) and themes. Especially important for Lazarus since its GUI framework has various backends that often look very different from each other. > And then how about version control? Lazarus (and Delphi - with the exception of some earlier versions - and really most GUI designers) save UIs in a text based format with a tree-like structure of key/value pairs, e.g. (i edited it a bit for brevity): object Main: TMain Left = 625 Height = 505 Top = 393 Width = 903 Caption = 'World Editor' Menu = MainMenu1 Position = poScreenCenter object plRenderContainer: TPanel Align = alClient BorderStyle = bsSingle object plRenderWindow: TPanel Align = alClient BevelOuter = bvNone end end end This can easily be stored in version control and diffed to see changes (in fact in my own projects before committing something to VCS i check both the code and the UI files to see what exactly i changed). reply hgs3 4 hours agorootparentprevYou solve this by using a layout control (a UI control specifically for managing the size/position of its child controls). For example using a visual form builder you could drag-n-drop a \"vertical layout control\" and then drag-n-drop controls inside it to be resized/positioned in a vertical stack. The window itself can have a layout control that stretches to fill the window regardless of resizing. Layout changes would cascade down through the tree of UI controls and everything would resize/reposition accordingly. reply diggan 11 hours agorootparentprev> But then what if the UI changes dimensions? Then you'd need an underlying set of rules, and isn't it best if you can set those rules yourself? How would that work graphically? Look into how various design tools handle flexible layouts.

Generally writing UI code in Xcode (and presumably before that on NeXT as well) is a breeze and a joy. Work with your delegates, connections, outlets etc. reply izacus 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd that's a good thing, because it discourages \"very custom stuff\" that made mobile apps such a usability disaster. reply atlasduo 11 hours agoparentprevIt is the same approach as declarative UI programming like SwiftUI or QML, but with an extra GUI abstraction on top of it. An artifact of this GUI-driven development process (like Xcode or Glade) is still a file with some declarative markup (sometimes even human-readable). reply steve1977 4 hours agorootparent> An artifact of this GUI-driven development process (like Xcode or Glade) is still a file with some declarative markup Not really in the case of Cocoa's Interface Builder (nib/xib files). There the artifact is basically a marshalled object tree of the actual UI objects, not declarative markup. reply treprinum 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is a big qualitative jump when one can arrange and play with UI without writing a single line of code, even if the user's decisions about component placement are recorded in a declarative file. reply datascienced 9 hours agoparentprevThe old fashioned screwdriver has it right.

The productivity difference in comparison to React, Qt, GTK etc. is enormous. When was the last time you built the whole UI of a large app in 1 day? reply rimliu 7 hours agoparentprevIt is not. macOS/iOS had it for a long time with AppKit, UIKit. But the progression is usually this: you start with Interface Builder and storyboards or .xibs, then you see the problem with that and gradually move to code-only UI and then start looking at SwiftUI with it's declarative UI like a guy in that meme. GUI for layout just does not cut it, especially when your app runs in very different environments - it can be macOS, it can be a phone or just a smartwatch/widget. reply steve1977 4 hours agorootparent> especially when your app runs in very different environments - it can be macOS, it can be a phone or just a smartwatch/widget.

Sure, it is an Open Source .NET framework but .NET is Microsoft at the end of the day. I do not (and still do not) want their fingerprints inside my GNU/Linux machine. What I mean by this is the legalities behind it. Remember, my comment above is based on views 20 years ago. My perspective is that Microsoft cannot \"beat\" Linux purely as competition. It isn't going anywhere. While it may not be a concern in the Desktop market, it certainly dominates on servers! Microsfot are not stupid and see CONTROL through other means. Imagine if most programs that come default in Linux distributions being C#? If more and more programs are written in C# (whether Mono or not) gives them power over the Linux user. Today, Microsoft has .NET core (recent release .NET 8) and also replaces Mono. We still have Xamarin of course but that is getting replaced with MAUI. A lot of Microsofts software is now cross platform, like Powershell, SQL Server, etc. This \"concern\" I was having 20 years ago is still just as big of an issue today. Imagine Microsoft getting the marketing right and SQL Server starts gaining momentum on Linux boxes. This means less using MySQL or Postgres. Imagine is Powershell starts gaining more traction in Linux land rather than Bash. Now -- I think this is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY to happen but you can garantuee this is a strategy. They have the money and manipulation skills to help make it happen. Big companies can easily eat this up and it starts with \"but we can support you!\" Think about it -- WSL is easy to setup on Windows machines! More and more C# applications can easily be tested for Linux. Microsoft just gave you the tools, and letting developers/companies do the rest for them. Soon it is sheep follow sheep. Bit of a long winded comment/reply - and while I do not share targeting hate towards anyone (I do not know Miguel personally but he seems like a cool guy) -- I just think efforts should have been elsewhere. Dlang could have been a really, really good replacement. My guess as to why Dlang didn't take off back them was the compiler was not open source. Who knows? reply devjab 11 hours agorootparentI think that most of what Microsoft does today on the developer front is focused on getting enterprise developers ever more integrated into azure. I live in a very Microsoft heavy part of Denmark, and the result is that virtually everyone uses azure and so do we. Take SQLServer as an example, a lot of FOSS database frameworks and orms don’t support it, even though there are some pretty decent Microsoft drivers for most languages. The result of this, when you use azure, is that you’re going to be using a different SQL server, or a different set of tools. It’ll often be the latter because on many enterprise subscriptions running SQLServer is quite a bit cheaper than running any other SQL DB in Azure. That’s the developer side of things, then on the more operations side of things it’s hard to justify not using Powershell if you’re running a lot of Microsoft products. It integrates very well with everything your IT operations department does anyway from EntraID to Azure Automation, where you may be able to use Python as well, but Python is often not what Microsoft IT operations people “grew up with”. So unless other cloud providers have a strong Powershell presence on their IT operations side of things, using them, instead of using Azure, because a huge change management issue… Often one you can’t really solve, because a lot of IT operations people will rather find a different job than switch away from their Microsoft focused talents, and why wouldn’t they? Good cloud operations people are harder to find than basically anyone else in IT. reply robertlagrant 9 hours agorootparentGiven Azure's support for Postgres is pretty good, I would push hard for this in any new projects. Makes you more portable in future, and you can spin up local environments more easily. reply pjmlp 12 hours agorootparentprevWell, many folks on the FOSS space are to blame, Microsoft has learned by the hordes buying Apple hardware, that what a large majority cares about is POSIX experience and very little about GNU/Linux itself. As usual, while Microsoft has its own actions to answer for, it isn't alone in making everything happen.

Can't speak for OP about why to combine it with Swift handling the UI, but certainly Vala still has far better support for the Gnome data model and APIs outside of those specific to the GUI. reply RussianCow 15 hours agorootparentI get that, but if you're going to deal with the impedance mismatch anyway, I would just go all in and use Swift for everything. But I guess that's assuming that GTK/GLib is fairly easy to wrap in a language like Swift, which I assume is true given all the different language bindings out there. reply badsectoracula 13 hours agorootparentI think a difference between Vala and everything else is that Vala has been written with gobject as its \"native\" object system whereas everything else uses the glib bindings. Kinda like using COM from Visual Basic 6 vs using it from plain C. reply pona-a 10 hours agoprevThat looks really nice! A healthy balance of reactive UI, expressiveness, and sanity. I wonder if there's a similar Swift binding for Qt... Ubuntu Touch and KDE could really benefit from that, as QML proved to be a total typing nightmare from my experience, often even slightly worse than regular JS thanks to its quirks... reply koito17 23 hours agoprevSomething like SwiftUI but open source and targeting GTK4 would be pretty close to my \"dream framework\" for cross-platform desktop UI. I will admit, Swift syntax is an acquired taste, but once you're familiar with all of the concepts (and understand that some design decisions were made for Objective-C interoperability), then it's a very usable language. To be frank, the only thing that stops me from using Swift is the fact that Linux support isn't as good as on Apple platforms. But if I am targeting nothing but Apple platforms, then Swift is probably the best choice, just for SwiftUI and SPM alone. reply firecall 20 hours agoparentFWIW I very much enjoyed using SwiftUI once I got the hang of it! I'd been out of iOS dev for a good long while, and was still thinking in UIKit and Obj-C. Overall I've found SwiftUI to be the most productive and enjoyable declarative framework and developer experience I've used! To be fair my experience is limited to React and Flutter, but still, Apple have done a rather excellent job IMHO! YMMV :-) reply mojuba 14 hours agorootparentRewriting an app from UIKit to SwiftUI not only eliminates storyboards but also reduces the code base. So once again: you have code plus storyboard XML vs. just code that is smaller! My jaw dropped when I first discovered this while rewriting something. Unfortunately though SwiftUI hasn't completely matured yet. Especially if you are targeting iOS versions prior to 16, you will encounter many of SwiftUI's shortcomings. Some (many?) UI components are still UIKit under the hood, scroll view and its derivatives are still not as flexible as you sometimes want them to be etc. For some custom UI tricks that would be a piece of cake in UIKit are impossible in SwiftUI and you often resort to wrapping the old components in your custom ones. Oh and don't get me started on resorting to the main thread (because of the underlying UIKit code) in the age of structured concurrency. All in all, the concept of SwiftUI coupled with structured concurrency is beyond amazing but its maturing process is still underway. reply dkh 22 hours agoparentprevI remember a few years ago, a few really cool cross-platform UI libraries were starting to emerge such as libui [0] that got me excited. I've kind of lost track of them since then (libui itself went dormant for a while before this fork) so I am not sure how mature/useful they are now, but the potential for writing native desktop UIs in basically any language seemed like an absolute dream. Perhaps it's feasible for very basic things?

Does the copyleft apply to all Flatpak apps written using Swift? reply flexagoon 17 hours agorootparentNo, it is the runtime, it's not a part of your app, it just runs it. You can basically think of it as a Docker container (but specifically for desktop apps). You don't have to make your app GPL, the same way as you can run a proprietary app on Linux even though the Linux kernel is GPL reply badsectoracula 13 hours agorootparentIt isn't that simple. If your application links against the runtime, be it dynamically or statically, then it is a derivative work and thus must be distributed under the GPL. This is why Java, also being under GPL, has an explicit exception for the runtime library despite even being a VM. The Linux kernel allows you to run proprietary apps because the kernel code and the userland code exist in two separate \"planes\" connected by the syscall interface. The kernel even has an explicit exception for any code that may need to be shared between the kernel and the userland to make clear that this code is excluded from GPL. As another similar case, the Free Pascal compiler is licensed under GPL including the runtime and almost all libraries/units that come with it but it also has an exception to allow linking without having the GPL extend to the programs the users write. AFAIK the GNU C library also has a similar GPL-with-linking-exception license. reply nextaccountic 20 hours agorootparentprevI thought that Apple actively avoided GPLv3 reply cglong 15 hours agorootparentIt looks like the runtime is owned by the author of this article, who (from his bio) doesn't seem to be affiliated with Apple.

The Kotlin platform looks good and I've kept an eye on it, but the problem is, if I have to start working on an app now, it's still kind of scary, as you're basically just placing a bet on a horse race of which one will mature the fastest down the road. At a previous job, I decided to adopt React Native in its early stages for a project. By some miracle (and with a lot of rolling-our-own) it managed to not hold us back and seemed to mature about as fast as we needed it to, but boy, even then it was still stressful, and I feel like we got a little lucky. (Just to be clear, I also knew this going into it and the choice was mine, I may just have a deathwish) reply marcprux 16 hours agorootparentTake a look at skip.tools. It's pure SwiftUI on iOS and Jetpack Compose on Android, with the tool automatically handling the translation from Swift to Kotlin as part of the Xcode build process. reply travisgriggs 18 hours agorootparentprevWe had a Kotlin app written with view bindings and the various other bits and pieces of Android app stack “no now this thing” detritus over the years. I hated it. I cut my teeth on 20 years of smalltalk, so it wasn’t even the “let’s hate on OO now” thing. It was just so much unfinished/inconstant things. We have been porting to Jetpack Compose, and I really like it. It’s still got some growing pains. We don’t use ViewModels, hardly any Flow stuff, just mutable states and render trees and I’ve been pretty pleased. What makes me happiest is that it’s much more consistent. I don’t feel like I’m in a line at the DMV anymore; “oh you need that, go stand in that line and learn that stack, then come back”. Like you, I’m extremely skeptical about the multiplatform siren. We tried it in Smalltalk land. The Java guys tried it and failed. I tried Flutter for a couple of apps, early testing iOS users were totally turned off (so fine for internal simple utility apps only). I would love it if someone really succeeded. We have 2 Swift UIKit apps I’ll have to convert to SwiftUI someday. So I will wish all that try well, but I’m not holding my breath at all. Having a “write once run everywhere” pitch is about the same as politicians who run on “change”. It always sells; it never really delivers. reply jwells89 17 hours agorootparentThe first two paragraphs has been my experience on Android too.

I agree with everything said so far, except I would argue Ant was easier to use. Every single Gradle build system I have encountered in the wilds of GitHub has been broken on Fedora. I eventually realised it works if I run it in an Ubuntu container (using \"toolbox\"). So it's only portable if you bundle up the OS with your build system. Now it should be portable. It's written in a JVM language and every Gradle project I have seen commits a copy of the Gradle JAR to its GitHub repo, which gives me those arbitrary code execution heebie-jeebies. reply e3bc54b2 13 hours agorootparentprevooh where do I start... Let's see: 1. Every single gradle script is a unique snowflake of mishmashed plugins and custom functions 2. Gradle likes to pretend it is declarative, but as people very quickly learn it really isn't. 3. The one thing a build system is expected to do is be reliable in face of changing platform version, libraries and plugins. But gradle, being built on top a language on top of JDK itself has a Compatibility Matrix[0] that one has to be aware of. Often when upgrading a project you have to update JDK and gradle in explicit order, sometimes multiple times. 4. Speaking of which, did you know that gradle, being designed to build java projects does not even manage multiple JDK versions?! 5. untyped groovy means you're forever left wondering whether what you wrote is actually correct until you run it, at which point it fails with excellent errors that tell you nothing. Granted, this situation has improved in recent days, but a jump from 90th floor compared to 100th is still painful. 6. Every single fkin thing that gradle offers can be done in half dozen ways and nothing tells you which way is better or why. Ex.A: is it providedCompile or implementation? Yes, one is intended to be a replacement for another, and no, they are /not/ same. 7. The 'One Nice Thing' gradle had going for is that it bootstraps itself. But look, if want to add gradle to a 'new' project, you have to install it to your system first and use it to add the wrapper. But after that, you are expected to use the wrapper. Nobody tells you that, you just have to figure it out. Oh and when it comes time to upgrade the wrapper version, you're to use the wrapper itself, not the system gradle, again mentioned nowhere, and if you try updating the wrapper using system gradle, the error helps exactly not. 8. Gradle takes free reign in breaking APIs /between minor versions/. WTF! 9. gradle starts a daemon to cache stuff, which is nice I guess. Except when you don't want it to run a daemon, so you tell it with `--no-daemon`. Do you know what that does? It starts a daemon, runs the build and shuts it down. This may not sound like a big deal, but it is just cherry on top of this shitcacke that tells you just how thoughtfully and well designed gradle is. /s /endrant [0]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html reply thfuran 6 hours agorootparent>4.

What about toolchains? reply newZWhoDis 18 hours agorootparentprevMy dealbreaker for kotlin is that it’s possible to call a throwing function with no indication it will throw. In swift, the compiler forces every throwing function do be inside a try/catch block or be called by another throwing function. I also am extremely unhappy that those functions can be 16 layers deep somewhere in a lib and cause your app to blowup. reply jwells89 18 hours agorootparentYep, this is a problem I’ve encountered several times. Even if none of your own code has unhandled throws, you’ll inevitably get crash reports coming in from fooLib throwing an exception somewhere because the moon was in the wrong phase. reply rockyj 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are entire languages built with unchecked exceptions, Python, Ruby, Nodejs and most recent ones.

The work is already done. Why write a common UI backend in swift when you can have the whole thing common using QML/Qt. It’s the best way to write native Multiplatform apps at the moment. It just is. reply pona-a 10 hours agorootparentFor me, QML, while expressive, had a lot of rough edges. If most of your logic is inside the C++ backend, its JS engine is just useless overhead. If you do something like lite data wrangling in QML, or worse, try to adapt existing JS libraries for it, it quickly becomes a nightmare of standard JS weirdness, non-compliance with normal JS, and just outright ridiculous and difficult to diagnose issues like data getting passed by reference from the previous page and that page getting popped off the stack, resulting in error. And besides that, QML tooling is virtually non-existent. Major code editors don't even ship basic syntax highlighting for it out-of-the-box, the linter doesn't catch anything useful forcing you back into manual testing, and recently added language-server is at best a little useless and at worst impossible to get working correctly because your components live inside the build container and cannot be installed on the host without risk to system stability (Ubuntu Touch Clickable and Lomiri.Components). If something like that was possible for Qt, I'd probably switch in a heartbeat. If our modern programing languages are finally expressive enough to write sane reactive UI and statically verify parts of your logic, why keep relying on the unverifiable and slow DSL? reply rubymamis 9 hours agorootparent> If most of your logic is inside the C++ backend, its JS engine is just useless overhead. Well, if most of your logic in C++, what's the problem then? For my app[1] most of the logic in C++ but there's still a good amount of logic in JS (out of laziness or ease). BTW, much of QML code is compiled to C++ these days[2] > difficult to diagnose issues like data getting passed by reference from the previous page and that page getting popped off the stack, resulting in error. This is very true, it's quite difficult to diagnose issues in QML, and it doesn't seem to me like Qt ships debugger tools for errors as available for C++ when a program crashes. I relate to your issues with syntax highlighting (although the linter is good imo). Also auto-complete is pretty bad in Qt Creator for QML. I wonder how feasible it is to integrate Typescript into QML rather than JS. But I think that while all these issues should be addressed, developing with C++ and QML is the most joyful combination I've experienced so far for GUI development (I also developed in React and React Native).

It makes the code readable. reply makeitdouble 21 hours agorootparentIt's still a tradeoff: in a previous team switching languages it openned the door to function with 5+ parameters, when that was highly throwned upon otherwise. It's a tool to help better manage complexity, and that naturally invites more complexity as well. reply bigyikes 19 hours agorootparentis that an issue of the language or of the team? adding additional names does not add additional complexity. complexity arises in interactions between components. reply makeitdouble 18 hours agorootparentI see it as mostly influenced by the language and tooling. From there, some people will be more attracted by one side or the other, but when moving stack you tend to follow the stack's natural incline. For instance ruby helps to have shorter, less verbose code, but with more hidden components. Rails rose from there, tooling tends to support that style. I've seen java devs moving to ruby and naturally writing less verbose code. In contract Java tooling makes it a lot more manageable to write 40 character long classes, deeper dependency trees and injections and potentially auto-generate half of the needed methods.

It's stable, has great tooling and good documentation.

It's not exactly the first alternative, GJS (Gnome JavaScript) have existed for a long time and is also a C-like language, so doesn't seem this would give too much value compared to just using GJS, unless you know Swift a lot better than JavaScript but the languages are similar enough that even that doesn't provide much value. AFAIK, GJS is an official Gnome project too, so there will be a vast difference in ecosystem support compared to Gnome apps written in Swift, which I'm not sure is so popular outside of Apple circles. reply codedokode 11 hours agorootparentJavaScript is non static-typed and you'll spend time fixing bugs that can be prevented by static typing.

Use TypeScript if types are so important for you. Others find their own way of handling those issues without getting tripped up on it. Hardly a reason to completely switch between two languages in my mind, but of course it's alright if it's reason enough for you. Luckily there are acceptable workarounds for both groups of people :) > Also, GJS is not well documented, as far as I remember. What exactly is missing here? There are guides for the basics, API reference exists and there is a ton of apps you can look into for inspiration and/or figure out specific implementations.

Without touching the fact that it is NOT a stable API and breaking changes are very common. Even the gold standard of GTK coding in C is still very undocumented outside of the happy path and confusing due to the Gtk 3->4 migration, and the only approach to learning it is by reading what other Gtk apps do. reply Betelgeuse90 9 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I used to think the same way about JS, because not having types allowed for very concise code sometimes. But the more I used Swift I realized how powerful type inference can be, and the difference in conciseness shrunk to basically nothing. reply diggan 9 hours agorootparentHeh, yeah, everyone's journey is different :) I started out being a big fan of static typing but eventually found that I'm usually hit by different issues than \"this was a int but I expected a string\" that were more important to be solved, so I'm mostly using dynamic languages nowadays. But that's what so great with programming languages, there are so many that work so differently, so there is at least one language for everyone, no matter how different your brain works :) By the way, if you're a fan of \"conciseness\" you should give a lisp-type languages a try if you haven't before, will show you a completely different level of conciseness!

And if you still need validation of data somehow, clojure.spec et al works great and will introduce you to some cool new things you probably haven't come across before :) reply knallfrosch 7 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't TypeScript – as mentioned above – solve all JavaScript type problems? I have, in 6 years, never encountered a single type error originating from a TS file. reply jwells89 4 hours agorootparentBiggest problems with TypeScript IMO are that it’s a layer rather than a language proper and that untyped JS problems can too easily worm their way in if you’re using any libraries at all. Also depending on the group of developers involved, the ease at which one can pull the escape hatch and opt out of TS is a liability and can render much of its benefit moot. reply SkiFire13 9 hours agorootparentprev> I still don't see how a language (GJS) with an already existing ecosystem of writing Gnome apps, lots of examples, API references and more is worse for writing Gnome apps than Swift, that seems to have been launched just some days ago?

Seems like you guys want either 0% or 100% ..that something either not exist at all or perfectly does everything you ever wanted without any effort or cost on your part. reply dkh 21 hours agorootparentIt doesn't have to be 100%, but nobody wants to invest a ton of time/energy into a project just to hit a wall a little ways down the road when something at the very core of it breaks or becomes unmaintained. Of course it would be nice for users of such projects to help and contribute, but this isn't always practical. Not because the users are being entitled assholes, but often times they aren't even the same skillsets, and I think this is especially true of some of this complicated, low-level UI stuff. If I'm a user of PyGObject writing GTK apps in Python, I'm not necessarily capable of contributing to the underlying C bindings, even if I wanted to be helpful. This dynamic presents a legitimate problem for pretty much any open source project that aims to abstract away something very complex to enable more developers to use it. Any project that does this is going to have more developers relying on it than are capable of contributing to it. You should never feel entitled to continued development of a project you don't contribute to, and you should always assess the community around tools you want to use in order to make good decisions. But this doesn't mean you can't be super frustrated if something you rely on goes dormant. I personally avoid using any library/package that doesn't appear to be very active, but nothing is foolproof. Even a seemingly healthy project die can fairly quickly in certain circumstances. reply lmm 22 hours agorootparentprevYou want a process and commitment, a clear distinction between which things are first-class and which things aren't. If this is just an experimental project that may not go anywhere, fine.

But it should be clear which it is. reply balder1991 21 hours agorootparentprevI think the discussion is valid, I don’t see it as complaining. People can create cool things, but you have to weight whether that can actually be used in practice. After all, until AI start writing software for us, maintaining a project takes time and effort.

Or, you know, that's a strawman, and we just want something that exists and is mature, like hundreds of other FOSS people are fine with, as opposed to basing our code on something that is immature, has little community, and will probably be abandoned when the authors get bored with it.

It also suffers a bit from being a commercially developed language in that its developers are clearly incentivized to add more features. reply dcgudeman 20 hours agoparent> a commercially developed language in that its developers are clearly incentivized to add more features. Do you have any evidence this is true? Most programming languages are developed either by a company (C#, Java, Swift, Go) or heavily influenced by many companies (Python, JavaScript, C++). Java had been criticized forever (until very recently) for it's slow pace of development and it was 100% controlled by either Sun or Oracle. Comments like these show just how little developers investigate the reasons why features they personally dislike were introduced to a language. reply MBCook 16 hours agorootparentAs a professional Java developer its new feature pace is still slow. It’s a little better but it hasn’t been fast in a VERY long time. But that’s OK. They do an amazing job of maintaining backwards compatibility and making things fit in the language well as well as trying to get it right the first time. Some languages are more willing to remove things that don’t work. Others are willing to have multiple different attempts that all work completely differently every few years.

The \"DispatchQueue\" seems to be a wrapper around \"fork/renice\". There is no attempt at memory protection. But it is full of little niggles that get very irritating in this day and age. I never used Objective-C so it may be a vast improvement on that. It is no longer 2005, and we deserve, and we have, better languages.

For example, I had to build a class that provides a thread-safe way to enqueue objects and process them in a background task, which used DispatchQueue internally.

It's a rethink of 3D graphics from the ground up, oriented around positioning glowing translucent orbs instead of textured polygons. The positioning and color of the orbs is learned by a NN given accurate multi-angle camera shots and poses, then you can render them on GPUs by ray tracing. The resulting scenes are entirely photo-realistic, as they were generated from photos, but they can also be explored. In theory you can also animate such scenes but how to actually do that is still a research problem. Whether this will end up being better than really well optimized polygon based systems like Nanite+photogrammetry is also an open question. The existing poly pipes are pretty damn good already. reply baxuz 11 hours agoparentWhat you're talking about is I think gaussian splats. NeRFS are exclusively radiance fields without any sort of regular 3d representation. reply lelag 11 hours agorootparentYes, I think Gaussian Splats are were all the rage is. My limited understanding is that Nerfs are compute-heavy because each cloud point is essentially a small neural network that can compute its value from a specific camera angle. Gaussian splats are interesting since they achieve almost the same effect using a much simpler mechanism of using gaussian values at each cloud points and can be efficiently computed in real-time on GPU. While a Nerf could be used to render a novel view of a scene, it could not do so in real-time, while gaussian splats can which opens up lots of use-cases. reply Mandelmus 8 hours agorootparent> My limited understanding is that Nerfs are compute-heavy because each cloud point is essentially a small neural network There's no point cloud in NeRFs. A NeRF scene is a continuous representation in a neural network, i.e. the scene is represented by neural network weights, but (unlike with 3D Gaussian Splatting) there's no explicit representation of any points. Nobody can tell you what any of the network weights represent, and there's no part of it that explicitly tells you \"we have a point at location (x, y, z)\".

Polygon based systems like Nanite took 40+ years to develop. With Moore's law finally out of the way and Huang's law replacing it for ML, hardware development is no longer the issue. Neural visual computing today is where polygons where in the 80s. I have no doubt that it will revolutionize the industry, if only because it is so much easier to work with for artists and designers in principle. As a near-term intermediate we will probably see a lot of polygon renderers with neural generated stuff inbetween, like DLSS or just artificially generated models/textures.

Some platforms have had some variant of \"click guided\" labelling for a while (eg V7) but they're not cheap to use. Prompt guided labelling is also pretty cool, but still in infancy (eg you can tell the model \"label all the shadows\"). Seg GPT for example. But now we're right back to LLMs...

The transformers win on held out training data (in-domain) but greatly underperform on novel data (generalization).

First, as you mentioned, Rudin continues to prove that the reason for using AI/ML is that we don't understand the problem well enough; otherwise we wouldn't even think to use it! So, pushing our focus to better understand the problem, and then levy ML concepts and techniques (including \"classical AI\" and statistical learning), we're able to make something that not only outperforms some state-of-the-art in most metrics, but often even is much less resource intensive to create and deploy (in compute, data, energy, and human labour), with added benefits from direct interpretability and post-hoc explanations. One example has been the continued primacy of tree ensembles on tabular datasets [0], even for the larger datasets, though they truly shine on the small to medium datasets that actually show up in practice, which from Tigani's observations [1] would include most of those who think they have big data. Second, we're seeing practical examples of exactly this outside Rudin! In particular, people are using ML more to do live parameter fine-tuning that outwise would need more exhaustive searches or human labour that are difficult for real-time feedback, or copious human ingenuity to resolve in a closed-form solution. Opus 1.5 is introducing some experimental work here, as are a few approaches in video and image encoding. These are domains where, as in the first, we understand the problem, but also understand well enough that there's search spaces we simply don't know enough about to be able to dramatically reduce. Approaches like this have been bubbling out of other sciences (physics, complexity theory, bioinformatics, etc) that lead to some interesting work in distillation and extraction of new models from ML, or \"physically aware\" operators that dramatically improve neural nets, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) [2], which embeds FFTs rather than forcing it to be relearned (as has been found to often happen) for remarkable speed-ups with PDEs such as for fluid dynamics, and has already shown promise with climate modelling [3], material science [4]. There are also many more operators, which all work completely differently, yet bring human insight back to the problem, and sometimes lead to extracting a new model for us to use without the ML! Understanding begets understanding, so the \"shifting goalposts\" of techniques considered \"AI\" is a good thing! Third, specifically to improvements in explainability, we've seen the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) [5] rapidly go from strength to strength since its introduction. While rooted in core explainability vis a vis making neural nets more mathematically tractable to analysis, not only inspiring other approaches [6] and behavioural understanding of neural nets [7, 8], but novel ML itself [9] with ways to transfer the benefits of neural networks to far less resource intensive techniques; which [9]'s RFM kernel machine proves competitive with the best tree ensembles from [0], and even has advantage on numerical data (plus outperforms prior NTK based kernel machines). An added benefit is the approach used to underpin [9] itself leads to new interpretation and explanation techniques, similar to integrated gradients [10, 11] but perhaps more reminiscent of the idea in [6]. Finally, specific to XAI, we're seeing people actually deal with the problem that, well, people aren't really using this stuff! XAI in particular, yes, but also the myriad of interpretable models a la Rudin or the significant improvements found in hybrid approaches and reinforcement learning. Cicero [12], for example, does have an LLM component, but uses it in a radically different way compared to most people's current conception of LLMs (though, again, ironically closer to the \"classic\" LLMs for semantic markup), much like the AlphaGo series altered the way the deep learning component was utilised by embedding and hybridising it [13] (its successors obviating even the traditional supervised approach through self-play [14], and beyond Go). This is all without even mentioning the neurosymbolic and other approaches to embed \"classical AI\" in deep learning (such as RETRO [15]). Despite these successes, adoption of these approaches is still very far behind, especially compared to the zeitgeist of ChatGPT style LLMs (and general hype around transformers), and arguably much worse for XAI due to the barrier between adoption and deeper usage [16]. This is still early days, however, and again to harken Rudin, we don't understand the problem anywhere near well enough, and that extends to XAI and ML as problem domains themselves. Things we can actually understand seem a far better approach to me, but without getting too Monkey's Paw about it, I'd posit that we should really consider if some GPT-N or whatever is actually what we want, even if it did achieve what we thought we wanted. Constructing ML with useful and efficient inductive bias is a much harder challenge than we ever anticipated, hence the eternal 20 years away problem, so I just think it would perhaps be a better use of our time to make stuff like this, where we know what is actually going on, instead of just theoretically. It'll have a part, no doubt, Cicero showed that there's clear potential, but people seem to be realising \"... is all you need\" and \"scaling laws\" were just a myth (or worse, marketing). Plus, all those delays to the 20 years weren't for nothing, and there's a lot of really capable, understandable techniques just waiting to be used, with more being developed and refined every year. After all, look at the other comments! So many different areas, particularly within deep learning (such as NeRFs or NAS [17]), which really show we have so much left to learn. Exciting!

The key insight (Jakob Uszkoreit) to using self-attention for language was that language is really more hierarchical than sequential, as indicated by linguist's tree diagrams for describing sentence structure. The leaves of one branch of a tree (or sub-tree) are independent of those in another sub-tree, allowing them to be processed in parallel (not in sequence). The idea of a multi-layer transformer is therefore to process this language hierarchy one level at a time, working from leaves on upwards through the layers of the transformer (processing smaller neighborhoods into increasingly larger neighborhoods). reply chronosift 9 hours agoprevA novel SNN framework I'm working on.

This can open up exciting areas in drug and alloy design, maybe find new CO2 capturing material's or better cladding for fusion reactors, to name just a few. The idea is that to solve these problems you need to solve the schrodinger equation (1). But the schrodinger equation scales really badly with the number of electrons and can't get computed directly for more than a few sample cases. Even Density Functional Theory (DFT), the most popular approximation that still is reasonably accurate scales N^3 with the number of electrons, with a pretty big pre factor. A reasonable rule of thumb would be 12 hours on 12 nodes (each node being 160 cpu cores) for 256 atoms. You can play with settings and increase your budget to maybe get 2000 (and only for a few timesteps) but good luck beyond that. Machine learning seems to be really useful here. In my own work on aluminium alloys I was able to get the same simulations that would have needed hours on the supercomputer to run in seconds on a laptop. Or, do simulations with tens of thousands of atoms for long periods of time on the supercomputer. The most famous application is probably alphafold from deep mind. There are a lot of interesting questions people are still working on: What are the best input features? We don't have any nice equivalent to CNNs that are universally applicable, though some have tried 3d convnets. One of the best methods right now involves taking spherical harmonic based approximates of the local environment in some complex way I've never fully understood, but is closer to the underlying physics. Can we put physics into these models? Almost all these models fail in dumb ways sometimes. For example if I begin to squish two atoms together they should eventually repel each other and that repulsion force should scale really fast (ok maybe they fuse into a black hole or something but we're not dealing with that kind of esoteric physics here). But, all machine learning potentials will by default fail to learn this and will only learn the repulsion to the closest distance of any two atoms in their training set. Beyond that and the guess wildly. Some people are able to put this physics into the model directly but I don't think we have it totally solved yet. How do we know which atomic environments to simulate? These models can really only interpolate they can't extrapolate. But while I can get an intuition of interpolation in low dimensions once your training set consists of many features over many atoms in 3d space this becomes a high dimensional problem. In my own experience, I can get really good energies for shearing behavior of strengthening precipitates in aluminum without directly putting the structures in. But was this extrapolated or interpolated from the other structures. Not always clear. (1) sometimes also the relativistic Dirac equation. E.g. fast moving moving atoms in some of the heavier elements move at relativistic speeds. reply rsfern 8 hours agoparentMore physical ML force fields is a super interesting topic that I feel like blurs the line between ML and actually just doing physics. My favorite topic lately is parametrizing tight binding models with neural nets, which hopefully would lead to more transferable potentials, but also let you predict electronic properties directly since you’re explicitly modeling the valence electrons Context for the non-mat-sci crowd - numerically solving Schrodinger essentially means constructing a large matrix that describes all the electron interactions and computing its eigenvalues (iterated to convergence because the electron interactions are interdependent on the solutions). Density functional theory (for solids) uses a Fourier expansion for each electron (these are the one-electron wave functions), so the complexity of each eigensolve is cubic in the number of valence electrons times the number of Fourier components The tight binding approximation is cool because it uses a small spherical harmonic basis set to represent the wavefunctions in real space - you still have the cubic complexity of the eigensolve, and you can model detailed electronic behavior, but the interaction matrix you’re building is much smaller. Back to the ML variant: it’s a hard problem because ultimately you’re trying to predict a matrix that has the same eigenvalues as your training data, but there are tons of degeneracies that lead to loads of unphysical local minima (in my experience anyway, this is where I got stuck with it). The papers I’ve seen deal with it by basically only modeling deviations from an existing tight binding model, which in my opinion only kind of moves to problem upstream reply occamschainsaw 8 hours agoparentprevI am currently working on physics-informed ML models for accelerating DFT calculations and am broadly interested in ML PDE solvers. Overall, I think physics-informed ML (not just PINNs) will be very impactful for computationally heavy science and engineering simulations. Nvidia and Ansys already have \"AI\" acceleration for their sims. https://developer.nvidia.com/modulus https://www.ansys.com/ai reply mynameismon 9 hours agoparentprev> In my own work on aluminium alloys I was able to get the same simulations that would have needed hours on the supercomputer to run in seconds on a laptop. Could you elaborate on this further? How exactly were the simulations sped up? From what I could understand, were the ML models able to effectively approximate the Schrodinger's equation for larger systems? reply dmarchand90 9 hours agorootparentWhat you do is you compute a lot of simulations with the expensive method. Then you train using neural neural networks (well any regression method you like). Then you can use the trained method on new arbitrary structures. If you've done everything right you get good, or good enough results, but much much faster. At a high level It's the same pipeline as in all ML. But some aspects are different, e.g. unlike image recognition you can generate training data on the fly by running more DFT simulations reply fennecfoxy 9 hours agorootparentThat's pretty cool! It seems like most of ML is just creating a higher dimensional representation of the problem space during training and then exploring that during inference. I suppose your process would be using ML to get pointed in the \"right direction\" and then confirming the models theories using the expensive method? reply dmarchand90 1 hour agorootparentYeah exactly like this. It is a subtle art of validating in small scale a method you would later use at large scale. reply aflip 9 hours agoparentprevibh i didn't understand most of that but sounds exciting. reply dmarchand90 6 hours agorootparentWe want to do computer experiments instead of real life experiments to discover or improve chemicals and materials. The current way of doing computer experiments is really really slow and takes a lot of computers. We now have much faster ways of doing the same computer experiments by first doing it the slow way a bunch of time to train an machine learning model. Then, with the trained model, we can do the same simulations but way way faster. Along the way there are tons of technical challenges that don't show up in LLMs or Visual machine learning.

I couldn't think of a better way to demonstrate that LLMs are poor at reasoning than using this crutch. reply fennecfoxy 9 hours agorootparentI suppose it's because LLM training data uses text that can contain reasoning within it, but without any specific context to specifically learn reasoning. I feel like the little reasoning an LLM can do is a byproduct of the training data. Does seem more realistic to train something not on text but on actual reasoning/logic concepts and use that along with other models for something more general purpose. LLMs should really only be used to turn \"thoughts\" into text and to receive instructions, not to do the actual reasoning. reply FrustratedMonky 6 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn't say 'crutch' but component. Eventually LLMs will be plugged into Vision Systems, and Symbolic Systems, and Motion Systems, etc... etc... The LLM wont be the main 'thing'. But the text interface.

There are numerous bugs and half working implementations. Pull requests are greatly appreciated. Installation Packages are available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Windows packages are available as an installer or a stand-alone zip file on the release page. The installer provides additional components such as an auto-updater and Windows context menu integration. You can easily install it with Winget: winget install dail8859.NotepadNext Linux packages can be obtained by downloading the stand-alone AppImage on the release page or by installing the flatpak by executing: flatpak install flathub com.github.dail8859.NotepadNext MacOS disk images can be downloaded from the release page. MacOS Tweaks By default, MacOS enables font smoothing which causes text to appear quite differently from the Windows version. This can be disabled system-wide using the following command: defaults -currentHost write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 0 A restart is required for this to take effect. Development Current development is done using Visual Studio 2022 and Qt v6.2+ on Windows. This is also known to build successfully on various Linux distributions and macOS. Other platforms/compilers should be usable with minor modifications. If you are familiar with building C++ Qt desktop applications with Qt Creator, then this should be as simple as opening src/NotepadNext.pro and build/run the project.

I use it to mass edit array items for example by using the highlight / add cursor to identical text feature in VS Code (Ctrl+D). I even use it to copy data out of the browser and mass edit it into data structures-- often there will be some pattern to the pasted data even if it's garbage, so being able to quickly set up multicursors around the patterns in the text makes this sort of task much easier, if you are luckily on how the data pastes out. Multicursors are the number one editor innovation of the last ten years that developers should get comfortable with-- once you start to use them you won't want to use an editor without them. reply twodave 1 hour agorootparentprevI use it to: * transform a list of field names into different formats (class properties, sql select list, etc.) * quick and dirty convert delimited text into insert statements or graphql queries or json objects * really anything I need to change in column mode but with better tracking of words via mod+arrow keys reply nolongerthere 1 hour agorootparentprevI use it daily in vscode to clean up small data sets where wrangling regex will take more time, and the data set isn’t something that I’m gonna see again so it’s not worth generalizing a solution. reply blacksmith_tb 1 hour agorootparentprevI use it all the time to mangle small amounts of data, like selecting all the newlines in a file with cntrl-d and making them into \",\" to make it into values for an array or something (obv. search+replace could do that, still it's quicker for a small number this way, or feels like it).

This, and auto-save (so not losing documents if you forget to save) is one of the main reasons I replaced Notepad with ++. Rather quickly, I found that I had to completely remove Notepad so muscle memory would stop guiding me to it. Good times (and sad ones; I lost a lot of lecture notes) -- nevertheless, Notepad++ is an excellent piece of software.

But, now that you asked, i wonder if there is a plugin or extenson for Kate that might provide such a feature? I myself am a fan of Notepad++, and install it on any corporate-issued Windows machine that i am given by dayjobs...but at home, its all linux all the time, so Kate comes closest for me.

It just works and is blazing fast (respectively plain vim, if you don't need plugins) reply kayodelycaon 1 hour agoparentprevYou probably already know this. VSCode has both autosave and hot exit features. If you quit the application when hot exit is enabled, it will restore all windows the next time you start it. I don't see any way to close individual windows without prompting but you can do command+w and then command+d to \"Don't Save\". reply tentacleuno 1 hour agorootparentOh yeah, VSCode's autosave has saved me hours in otherwise-lost code. I do make frequent use of its hot-exit functionality, too. While that's great, I wish the same thing existed for a lightweight Notepad-esque app, too: I used ++ a lot for quickly jotting down information while it was being read to me (so, on the phone); having to start a full-blown IDE for this seems wasteful, and not the right tool for the job. Perhaps the solution is just to leave VSCode open all the time, but that wouldn't work either: whenever I switch workspaces, I'm asked whether I'd like to save the unsaved files (so, just like Kate), and it can be quite resource intensive.

However, I tried it out for about 10 seconds before closing it and never looked back. The, what I call \"millions of tiny buttons\" interface is ugly and distracting. I've never liked IDEs or other apps with this UI style.

Progress is great… reply nine_k 3 hours agorootparentprevThere is no \"One size fits all\" UI, sadly. Absolute beginners should be shown a basic interface front and center, with a clear way to access more advanced features. More advanced users may benefit from a plethora of rich controls, all shown together. Experts may want to remove the visual clutter because they access features from keyboard without looking. Good software offers a way to achieve all of these, and often more customization. reply jvanderbot 3 hours agorootparentJust give me a view->toolbars-> checklist and I'll sort it out.

I otherwise use JetBrains for other languages, or when on other OS' it was a shame VS for Mac went away, but I assume adoption was not very high. reply jwells89 2 hours agorootparentprevI think an argument can be made for toolbars if they’re customizable with no holes barred on customizability (looking at you, Firefox, with your non-optional hamburger menu) and can be hidden entirely, should the user choose to do so. For me, toolbars as they were commonly implemented in Cocoa apps for the first half of OS X’s history are the model example here, which offer all the above. It’s when they’re not fully customizable and aren’t optional when they grate on me. reply darby_eight 3 hours agorootparentprev> It's way easier to find the correct tool bar icon than trying to hunt for a feature inside the menus. What? I am just completely confused by this—menu items are labeled in clear textual language, sorted roughly by functionality. icons greatly depend on cultural context. Looking at a screenshot of notepad++ I could would understand maybe a third of the icons and could guess at another third at best. That said, it's not that big of a deal—I'd probably just disable the toolbar rather than figure it out. I don't really use the mouse outside of selecting regions of text anyway. reply jwells89 2 hours agorootparentI find it depends on how many things are in the toolbar, and if the icons are actually icons or monochromatic glyphs. A toolbar that’s populated only with the most frequently used functions and employs full color, uniquely shaped icons can be visually grokked in an instant, whereas a densely packed toolbar full of glyphs is inscrutable at a glance. reply Dalewyn 3 hours agorootparentprevOnce you learn a toolbar, it just becomes visual and muscle memory. Not unlike using hotkeys to access something hidden under a couple layers of menus. reply darby_eight 3 hours agorootparentSure, but that's very different from \"feature discovery\". I totally get this with the floppy-disk icon (which is, ironically enough, now a terrible visual metaphor for persisting to local storage outside of cultural context), but I have no clue what \"up arrow on top of down arrow\" means, nor what the ¶ icon would do—start a new paragraph? Select the current paragraph? Open some kind of paragraph outline? Granted, I don't use windows so it's entirely possible I'm just showing my ass here. reply Dalewyn 2 hours agorootparentThe toolbar buttons all have hover text to ease the learning, ¶ is \"Show All Characters\" where \"characters\" mean stuff like Carriage Return and whitespace. Microsoft Word users are probably familiar with this meaning. I have no idea what \"up arrow on top of down arrow\" is though, because I don't have that button. reply codedokode 2 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with tool bars is that usually you cannot guess what 80% of the icons mean. reply jprd 2 hours agorootparentIf you hover over the icon, a tooltip pops up to help remind/train you on what the icons represent. reply codexb 33 minutes agoparentprevNotepad++ originated at a time when there weren't many code editors for most of the new, growing languages (perl, python, js), or for editing xml and json, especially on windows. Many of the \"good\" code editors were expensive and enterprisey, or they were limited to linux, or they had an extremely steep learning curve (vim, emacs). Notepad++ worked on everything, was free, installed quickly, and it was fast. I've used it to replace hardcoded values in binary files before. I think most of the people who are praising it are remembering how valuable it was 20 years ago.

It’s form over function. The old ui (thankfully still available).

The new commit window alt+0 is better, the old modal always felt tacked on when everything else is a docked panel. reply hyperman1 3 hours agorootparentI tried it. The first week I shared your opinion. But then something flipped. I configured and learned hotkeys to hide the file/services/... pane and ended up with something I can only describe as 'calm'. Only 1 or 2 panes of code visible, and all functions hidden but available. The main detractor is indeed the hamburger menu. Vscode had ctrl-p, emacs has alt-x, and both provide a way to search for some function to execude. I hope Jetbrains is hiding something similar in its innnards, but haven't found it yet. Ctrl ctrl isn't it, at least for me. I went all-in on Jetbrains Ultimate last year without regrets. The thing is great and powerfull, but it is hard to find what you need in there, and hard to find out what is the purpose of some functionality. I've actually lost usefull functionality: Something usefull but I don't remember the name and can't find it in the menus. I should spend some time spellunking in there.

There's always a learning curve, but after using it for months I haven't found any reason to switch back. ctrl+ctrl is \"run anything\" (I tend to use ctrl+alt+r for the different but similar run menu instead).

Handles gigabyte files ease unlike Windows notepad. It also is great with regex searching to filter useful log content with cascading results. Temporary scratch pad, for constructing SQL statements, that retains unsaved files upon OS or user closing. Not my go-to for coding and project maintenance.

I find it easier to skim through menus. You can turn off almost all of the extra UI elements if you want, which makes the interface very clean. reply j1elo 3 hours agorootparentFunny that something as simple as hiding a toolbar requires diving through 5 steps. Doesn't it just offer that option upon right-click? It sounds natural and expected to me for a toolbar to do so. reply AdamH12113 3 hours agorootparentIt's really two or three steps -- select menu item, dialogue box page is already selected by default, click on checkbox. I was giving the full navigation. Personally, I find that making every part of the UI an active control makes it easy to do things by mistake, especially hiding elements, which often doesn't have an obvious way to reverse the process. For one-time UI setup, I don't mind going through a dialogue box. reply wolpoli 2 hours agorootparentprevI just tried it and was surprised that it doesn't offer Right-Click option to customize/turn off the toolbar.

It has been actively maintained for 20 years. It’s lightweight with a super responsive UI. I love the text search/replace interface. I keep a copy of the portable version on my keychain thumb drive because I never know when a friend or family member will have me muck around with their pc. Npp Version 7 runs splendidly on wine. I prefer it over the linux desktop text editors like Kate (which is a great editor in its own right). I don’t think NotepadNext appimage or flatpak will be able to match Npp in regards to memory footprint and ui responsiveness. But, I am excited to use it and it may find it’s way onto my thumbdrive because it runs natively on Linux so it doesn’t depend on wine. reply butz 2 hours agoparentI was not expecting much, but AppImage startup time and responsiveness looks promising. Memory usage in GNOME System Monitor looks decent (AppRun.wrapped - 13.9MB, NotepadNext - 876.5 kB). Typing feels much faster than Linux version of VSCode, maybe even reaching levels of SublimeText? Need to test with much bigger documents with complicated syntax highlighting to make sure. Overall, the major Notepad++ selling point - autosave on exit - is not implemented here, so until then I'll be going back to Geany, but will keep my eye on this. And forgot to mention that it decently integrates into GNOME desktop as well, no issues with decorations and missing app in Alt+Tab list. reply jtriangle 2 hours agoparentprevNotepadqq on linux is basically 1:1 with notepad++ reply StuffMaster 2 hours agoparentprevI also love Notepad2.

I started down the Geany route, and liked it alot. It is cross-platform, not slow, has lots of themes, customization options, etc. But eventually I stopped using it, and landed on Kate. For the life of me can't recall why i moved away from Geany? I have been a user of KDE Plasma for many years, but that's not the reason why i moved to Kate, because i actually was still a user of Geany for quite a while during my use of KDE Plasma. In any case, Geany is a really solid option. Not sure that Geany is a feature-for-feature, perfect alternative for Notepad++ (but neither is my favorite Kate editor either!)...nevertheless, the rare times when people ask me for recommendation of text editors on linux (or cross-platform with the intent of using the same editor on all their OSes), I often stick to suggesting Geany or Kate. And, then of course, if they're exclusively Windows users i then suggest either Notepad++ or Geany Kate - not necessarily in any order. (For the Windows machines that my dayjobs issue me, I still use Notepad++ since funny enough that is easier to allow then requesting to install Kate! Corporate world be getting all strict on software installations nowadays - yikes!) reply nsteel 3 hours agorootparentprevExactly this. It's already cross platform (windows and Linux, at least), extendable, looks very similar and has many of the same features. I'm not sure what killer feature is missing that would make someone reimplement the whole thing. The readme weirdly doesn't mention it. reply AlienRobot 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, but Notepad++ is a Windows app, that is a GTK app. As someone coming from Windows, it's crazy how bad GTK apps look for desktop. Crazy. Like I can't comprehend how did it get to this point. Just compare the screenshots https://www.geany.org/media/uploads/screenshots/geany_light_... https://notepad.plus/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screen.gif Notepad has 16 toolbar buttons in the same amount of width that GTK can only fit 10 toolbar buttons. The height of the tabs and status bars are also MUCH shorter. It's completely ridiculous and makes every GTK app look bad to me. Not just Geany, but Xed, Pluma, Gedit, the image viewers, the file managers, the system settings dialogs, etc. I have a mouse. I can point at things. I'm not using my thumbs or toes to operate a desktop app. Qt's licensing sounded a bit weird. At first I thought your app HAD to be open source to use it. But once it was clear to me that you can sell apps made with Qt so long as you dynamically link without having to pay royalties or anything, the choice was clear. If I have to program an app for Linux, I'm using Qt. And so far the only problem I found in Qt is that it uses the system's \"native\" GUI by default (i.e. it uses Gtk on Linux). This means that the Ok-Cancel buttons are Cancel-Ok instead of the correct order. Who puts Ok buttons at the right side? Now if I want to quickly close something, I'm clicking at the corner of the window which is the easiest point to click at, and on the top right I have close (which cancels) and at the bottom right I don't have cancel but Ok which COMMITS which is the opposite of what a thoughtless rash speedy click is supposed to do. Ok should be at the left so you can't commit things by accident. The only reason to put it on the right is if you're designing for tablets so the ok button is closer for right-handed users. This isn't how a decision for a desktop-oriented design. reply ramon156 3 hours agoparentprevI never needed a replacement but I tried Kate for quick edits and honestly it's a very lovely implementation reply ww520 3 hours agoparentprevI have run Notepad++ with Wine on Linux before and it works well.

VS Code for example absolutely chokes on large files. Sublime does an ok job - but not one I can rely on for larger batch jobs. NPP excels, and I can quickly do thousands of changes on thousands of large files quickly. NPP also has many plugins (like Sublime etc), and its utility depends on them as much as the other text editors do. reply Brian_K_White 1 hour agoparentprevI use vim and geany and code::blocks and np++ for different things at different times. geany, codeblocks, and np++ are all scintilla, so what I am really saying is I use both \"something like vim or emacs\" AND scintilla, and there is no dichotomy. And what is \"something like vim or emacs\"? The two are nothing like each other. Anyone who used either vim or emacs already knows why they do so, and already knows that none of the reasons anyone will say they like any normal editor will apply. Everything anyone says will either be something vim or emacs already has their own answer for, or will be things they actively don't want. Question seems somewhere between disingenuous to inexplicable. I would say rather than an actual request for information, it was just to say \"I like vim or emacs\", except \"I like vim or emacs\" makes no sense because they are not substitutions for each other. reply bregma 1 hour agorootparentUnless you're looking for a compelling reason to switch.

I saw all this pretty syntax highlighting, and the ability to use tabs, and I decided to use it. I got pretty good with it, even making custom macros and the like, and as I was learning C and C++ on Windows it was still the text editor I used. The reason I stopped using it really did just come down to the fact that it didn't work on Linux. I had already been dual-booting Windows by 2011, and when Windows 8 got announced I utterly hated it so much that I decided to just do Linux full-time. While I was aware that Notepad++ worked on Wine, I didn't really want to muck with anything emulator or emulator-adjacent, so I just picked up Emacs and Vim (went back and forth for multiple years until finally settling on Vim). I will need to look at NotepadNext.

    "originBody": "Digital wallets and the “only Apple Pay does this” mythology Posted by Matt Birchler 22 Mar 2024 — 5 min read Apple Pay is great, but I think there is some misunderstanding out there about the details of how it works. John Gruber has some choice words for Merrick Garland and crew, but this paragraph stood out as uniquely interesting to me: Apple Pay through Wallet obfuscates your actual credit card numbers, which retailers infamously use to track customers. It’s far more private than using your credit card itself. I highly doubt any banks or credit card issuers would do this themselves if given access to NFC tap-to-pay. Payments you say? My specialty! First off, this obfuscation is referring to the DPAN, which is distinct from the FPAN. Ahem, sorry for the jargon, but it's important to understand what's happening, so let me explain. The FPAN is the “funding primary account number” and it’s the 15-18 digit number printed on your physical card. The DPAN is your “device primary account number”. Think of the DPAN as something like DNS records. When you type “birchtree.me” into your browser, your browser is able to determine what IP address this domain is related to and directs you there. I can keep my website physically in the same place on the same IP address, but I can change the domain to birchtree.com or wigglewobble.org and browsers will know what to do without the user needing to know what IP address is involved. This might be the nerdiest way to explain DPANs, but I know my audience, so I think this may have helped at least some of you. Your same card used through Apple Pay on your iPhone and iPad will show different DPANs, though since each device gets its own number. It’s notable that it’s called a DPAN and not “the Apple Pay number” – it’s a generic term, and that’s because this is a standard feature of digital wallets everywhere, not just Apple Pay. Google Pay and Samsung Pay are the biggest other digital wallets in the U.S. and they both do exactly the same thing. While it’s not technically using a DPAN since the payment runs through different companies, Amazon Pay and Shop Pay buttons also obscure the actual FPAN (full card number) from merchants. I feel like this comes up a lot, but I can not stress enough to you how little merchants want to ever ever ever handle your actual credit card number. It adds so much risk on their end and modern payment acceptance tools make it easy to collect payment details in a way that makes sure as few people as possible have access to the real card info. Gruber mentions banks absolutely not wanting to use DPANs themselves, but we actually don’t need to speculate about this, we have this info already. Numerous banks from Walls Fargo to Chase to Bank of America have (or had) digital wallets, all of which used DPANs to protect your plain text account number. Paze is what a few big U.S. banks use today and it of course uses DPANs as well. In fact the top reason they give for why you should use Paze is, “Paze does not share your actual card number with the merchant.” On tracking customers Then there’s the issue of the DPAN changing over every transaction, which wasn’t called out by Gruber, but I see people floating around. This is not really true, though. A previous version of this post suggested the DPAN changes between merchants, but that was a mistake. Serves me right for cranking this post out too quickly. Seriously, my bad. The DPAN is always the same for subsequent transactions at the same merchant. So yes, while this can hinder data brokers from easily buying transaction data from a bunch of different merchants and figuring out shopping trends across those merchants, it does nothing to stop a single merchant from seeing your transaction history with just the DPAN provided by Apple Pay. If that Target story from forever ago about Target knowing a teen was pregnant based on their Target purchase history, Apple Pay doesn’t stop someone like Target from being able to track that. And yes, it’s the same with the other digital wallets out there. A final thing to note about DPANs is that they are much better for you as a customer in the event of a data breach. No merchant should be handling your credit card number directly in 2024, but let’s say the payment gateway gets hacked and leaks the DPAN and expiration date for a transaction you ran at a shop. In that case, the attacker wouldn’t be able to do anything with your DPAN they acquired because DPANs only work when submitted as a part of an encrypted bundle that’s unique to each transaction. There is a way to run recurring transactions on a card collected via Apple Pay, but that should not be possible for a hacker and now we’re a bit in the weeds, so let’s just say that your FPAN being in a data breach is way worse than your DPAN which is collected by all digital wallets. Personal info in Apple Pay There’s also an idea I see sometimes (again, not in Gruber’s linked post, but that I want to clear up anyway) that Apple Pay obscures your personal information. That’s simply not true. Because I’m a very dedicated blogger, I actually ran a real Apple Pay transaction on one of my test merchant accounts (but that run very real transactions) and looked at the merchant-level reporting for it. Here’s what I see as the merchant for this Apple Pay transaction: I’ve blurred out a good amount of it because that’s my real billing and home address as well as my full name and email address. And if you think about it, of course that info would be there! In this example, my checkout page was for a physical item so I needed the customer’s shipping info. Apple Pay’s SDK allows me to choose what personal info I want to get from the customer, and it’s for this exact sort of situation. Oh, and product info can be passed into Apple Pay to show you what you’re buying, and that info is sent to the merchant as well. Again, of course it is since the merchant needs to know what you bought. Basically, when that Apple Pay card pops up when you’re checking out, expect everything on that card to be sent to the merchant. In that way it’s just like all other payment forms; the merchant chooses how much personal info they want or need to collect, and Apple Pay doesn’t prevent them from asking you for that at checkout. And yes, this is how other digital wallets work. Takeaway I hope what you take away from this post is that while Apple Pay is a great way to pay for things and that Apple did a great job mainstreaming digital wallets like this, what they do is not unique in the industry. DPANs are great for making it harder to track one person’s purchases across multiple merchants and they make customers less at risk in the event of a data breach of payment card info. None of us can know everything about everything, and I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect everyone to know about all the details of how digital wallets work. That’s why I find opportunities like this to be so useful; I can share more info than most in this Apple niche, and I hope it’s informative.",

I used to think they simply pass on my CC details to the merchant or the merchant's chosen payment gateway in one way or another (obfuscated or not), and the OP suggests the same. Moreover, I noticed that some merchants refuse my payment when I use e.g. Google Pay with my Amex instead of my MasterCard. However, I'm sometimes under the impression that Apple/Google take on the role of a payment gateway or a payment method themselves. After all, they collect all my transaction data, and it also seems payment terminals at the grocery store needed special support for the Apple/Google Pay apps. Interestingly, this comment[0] is saying the opposite, namely that at least Apple Pay is very much rooted in standards. But what is Apple and Google's special proprietary sauce then? Why are these apps so hard/impossible to replace by open-source alternatives? Is it because only Apple/Google get full access to the NFC chips on iOS/Android?

Many banks across the world offer their own HCE wallets, but these only run on Android (Apple simply doesn't offer the necessary APIs, although that's now changing in the EU). What does matter a lot are defaults: You can only have one default Visa, Mastercard etc. wallet per device (that you don't need to specifically need to open before tapping your phone), so Google Pay has a huge advantage there, since it supports cards by many banks and not just one as would be the case for an issuer HCE wallet. > However, I'm sometimes under the impression that Apple/Google take on the role of a payment gateway or a payment method themselves.

The underlying card brand still needs to be accepted by the merchant. Unlike e.g. early Google Pay (or what it was called back then; I lost track) and some other solutions, modern-day Google Pay and Apple Pay aren't \"proxy cards\" (which can sometimes change the card brand, e.g. from Visa to Mastercard; an example of that would be Curve). > it also seems payment terminals at the grocery store needed special support for the Apple/Google Pay apps. They don't. Unless a given POS terminal is buggy, it'll work anywhere that otherwise accepts the underlying card scheme. The physical and logical protocols are exactly the same as for actual plastic cards and mostly indistinguishable to the terminal; actually breaking Apple Pay/Google Pay support needs a lot of destructive energy on the merchant's/PSP's side.

US-based here... My local HD does NOT do contactless of any variety. It's chip or swipe. Same for my local Thai food carry-out. I would have sworn my local bicycle shop did contactless for cards only (but not devices) - I'll have to test that next time I'm there. It could just be that the pub/cafe side has a contactless reader but the retail side is chip/swipe-only (effectily two businesses in the same space and owned by the same person). reply noodlesUK 10 hours agorootparentprevI believe they don't have NFC enabled on the terminals at all. Same with Walmart (allegedly, I haven't been there in a while). I've heard rumours that the reason for this is so they can do customer tracking more reliably, but I'm not sure how much more valuable an actual card PAN is than a DPAN if the DPAN isn't getting rotated. reply joshstrange 10 hours agorootparentI’ve seen the data the reader gives us from a dip vs a tap (inserting your card vs NFC) and there is a difference. IIRC we would get the name on the card from a dip but not from a tap. In both cases we get the last 4 digits though. reply phil21 9 hours agorootparentAt Home Depot at least they do this due (in part, if not in whole) to returns. Your virtual card number may change, since it’s generated every time you add it to a device. This breaks their easy return lookup where you simply present the item and your card, no receipt needed. I actually ran into exactly this when I tried to make a return to Target after losing my receipt. I had replaced my phone and the card number changed. Luckily for random reasons I had my old phone laying around still and was able to come back and return with that. Having done a receipt based return vs. dozens of card based returns at Home Depot, the staff time involved is orders of magnitude more so I understand why they would turn NFC off. Tracking may be part of this consideration too, but I’d speculate it’s secondary. reply Reason077 10 hours agorootparentprev> \"this doesn't fit my experience. For example, Home Depot doesn't accept apple pay but their chip readers work with other cards.\" It must be different in the US, then. In Europe, Canada, and elsewhere, any terminal that accepts standard contactless cards (ie: pretty much 100% of them now days) will accept Apple Pay/Google Pay. When Apple Pay first launched, there was an issue where some older terminals would apply the unauthenticated contactless payment transaction limit (£50 or whatever), instead of recognising that device-authenticated payments should have no limit. But that's long since been fixed. reply rimunroe 8 hours agorootparentI don’t know much about the underlying tech, but some large retailers (Target sprints to mind) resisted adding contactless payments and push users to use their own app. Some quick searching indicates they may have added support in 2018 or 2019.

In the early days of mobile payments, I remember that some terminals were configured to enforce the legal limit for contactless cards (which was 30€ IIRC) even if you paid with mobile.

Curve does that too. reply sitharus 15 hours agoparentprevThe only “secret sauce” is the liability shift. Traditional online and contactless payments are classed as “cardholder not present” transactions which place more liability for fraud on the merchant. Apple and Google Pay (and other bank-provided payment apps) use biometrics to confirm cardholder authorisation, switching a subset of payment types to cardholder present. This means some chargeback types are instantly declined, and others have a lower requirement for merchant proof. This is all part of the card network standards, which are freely available if you’re interested from https://www.emvco.com/ The reason there’s no open source option is the requirement to certify the implementation’s security, so you need a commercial entity to work with the banks. Oh, and every bank has to integrate separately - that’s a lot of banks to talk to. reply Nursie 11 hours agorootparentContactless card transactions are not “Cardholder not present” transactions! They are usually “No Cardholder Verification Method” transactions, though they can do ask for PIN entry in some circumstances. And no, the liability is not with the merchant for contactless, or they never would have accepted it! It’s firmly with the banks, which is why the limits were initially so low - to limit potential fraud. When it transpired that fraud was more than acceptably low, they raised the limits a bit. The liability is only with the merchant if the merchant chooses to accept a magnetic swipe transaction, or keyed card details. Not contactless EMV. reply anticensor 7 hours agorootparent> They are usually “No Cardholder Verification Method” transactions, though they can do ask for PIN entry in some circumstances. In Turkey, contactless transactions are \"Special Cardholder Verification Required, no PIN\" or \"Cardholder Present, PIN required\" depending on the amount. And they are legally required to be performed online with immediate confirmation. reply mainde 19 hours agoparentprev>Moreover, I noticed that some merchants refuse my payment when I use e.g. Google Pay with my Amex instead of my MasterCard. In my experience this is normally due to either how the card machine provider has set up the device or due to the lack of certification of the mobile wallet functionality on the \"acquirer\" backend (\"host\") that speaks to the card schemes. It's annoyingly tricky to get the end-to-end transaction working properly across all schemes, all payment methods and devices. Different card schemes support different \"payment kernel\" parameters and have different certification requirements. It could also be an attempt to save money on transaction fees, amex is generally significantly more expensive for merchants. reply EricE 5 hours agorootparentWhen I briefly had my own store I blocked amex because of their ridiculous fees.

That was a while ago so maybe they have improved, but I still occasionally run into places that don't take them so I guess not. reply Nursie 18 hours agorootparentprevHistorically, Amex always required a separate retailer relationship and to act as its own acquirer. I don't know how true that is any more. They've just always been the awkward one, with higher fees and special relationships. Also they used to use ANSI standards on some stuff where everyone else used ISO... but that's going back 20 years! reply inkyoto 17 hours agorootparentYes, that is still true – AmEx own their own payment processing network, and they do not allow outsiders into it, even banks they have the brand sharing agreements with, hence a separate retailer relationship. reply devmor 18 hours agorootparentprev>Different card schemes support different \"payment kernel\" parameters and have different certification requirements. Those certification requirements are one of the biggest hurdles because they can change quite often, and unless you are a high-volume gateway, there may be no leniency for you, making simply refusing the transactions cheaper than processing them and being fined.

CC number is randomized per transaction so that the merchant does not receive the real CC number. I've seen cases contactless payment is not supported only for a particular brand and I believe it's because of missing software update on the payment terminal. reply 1ncorrect 20 hours agorootparentIt’s randomised in a similar way to how iOS creates privacy MAC addresses for each WiFi SSID. The merchant receives the same ‘random’ card number for transactions from the same device. reply lxgr 18 hours agorootparentThe device card number (DPAN) is static after adding a card to a given device. It doesn’t change between transactions or merchants. reply ffsm8 20 hours agorootparentprevHonestly apples approach is pure security theater, as they're not an acquirer that process the transaction at the end. Instead the real acquirer now reverses apples masking. The merchants themselves aren't allowed to store the credit card information anyway, otherwise they'd lose their PCI certificate, losing the ability to process credit cards. And if they use a payment processor, then they didn't ever get in contact with the credit card information either. No clue how/if Google does anything. I was just involved in implementing apple pay at a payment processor that was also an acquirer a few years ago. Ultimately, we've had the same information on the consumer, wherever they used Apple pay or just a regular credit card reply lathiat 18 hours agorootparentI am not an expert in this so I can't explain it in any truly deep detail, and you might be right in terms of \"Masking\" the identity of the card number if you think this is a privacy feature, but there is much more to it than security theater of a per-device DAN. Both when using EMV Contactless and when using Apple Pay on the web, some kind of dynamic and/or encrypted data is signed by the secure element of the device. EMV Contactless definitely signs the whole transaction, with Apple Pay on the web in at least some cases it will use either a dynamic CVV code and/or \"cryptogram\" containing the transaction data similar to the contactless protocol that verifies that specific payment request was signed by the secure device/card. The payment processors can use this to know the transaction is freshly authorised and is not a replay of a skimmed credit card number/CVV (whether skimmed from another apple pay transaction, or skimmed from entering the static physical card details). On the merchant/processor side, I believe in some cases you may get a better rate or different fraud protection for such transactions (especially at a large scale), or, it will also factor into the fraud control and the bank/payment network/etc are less likely to reject such a payment as fraud where as it may be more likely to reject the static physical card details as fraud, etc. If someone knows better or different then please do share.

The same is true for chip card payments. What makes Apple Pay significantly more secure in practice is that issuers can limit the device-specific card number to be only usable with a chip cryptogram, and not e.g. by manually typing it in on a website. For POS and online payments, the idea was the same (eventually depreciate cryptogram-less use entirely and use 3DS online and chip/EMV at the POS), but alas, it never quite happened that way. > On the merchant/processor side, I believe in some cases you may get a better rate or different fraud protection for such transactions (especially at a large scale) Apple Pay usually shifts the liability for fraud to the issuer, yes.

IIRC in some countries this means it's accepted more or has higher payment limits. reply caf 17 hours agorootparentprevDo the chip / paywave payments with the physical card also use a DPAN generated for that card, or do they use the FPAN that's embossed on the plastic? reply lxgr 16 hours agorootparentA physical card usually uses the number embossed on the plastic on all other channels (i.e. magnetic stripe, chip, contactless) as well. That's not a hard rule – some cards have no number embossed/printed at all (e.g. the Apple Card), and it's technically possible to use different numbers. But I haven't really seen it done since it could cause quite some confusion, as e.g. some airlines use the card number to look up your online booking at self-check-in machines, which wouldn't work if the two differ. There are also some special cases of things that are technically regular old smartcards but that do (I believe) use tokenization/DPANs, like wearable form factor contactless payment devices by Swatch or Fidesmo. reply caf 16 hours agorootparentAhh, that makes sense - in fact I just used a credit card to pick up linked online Shinkansen bookings from the JR-West ticket machines.

Short attention span. reply numpad0 17 hours agoparentprevI suspect there are more than just one combination of frontend and backend for Apple/Google Pay depending on how you're paying, masked behind that act of you presenting the device and store presenting the reader. So I think there can be cases where \"payments\" (or promises thereof) can be made, while money withdrawn from banks notwithstanding, e.g. queued in an intermediary entity and manually resolved on request, in which cases the payment gateway might want to pattern detect and shut down such cases. reply Nursie 18 hours agoparentprevThey work using contactless EMV, which is the same way contactless credit cards work, and is the standard behind Visa/MC's Paywave and Paypass products. This is why wireless terminals in general just work with apple and google pay and actually didn't need much in thw way of special support. From what I recall one of the few things that did change was raising of payment limits for these devices over contactless cards, because they are deemed more secure (can't be used by just anyone that happens to have stolen it). > Why are these apps so hard/impossible to replace by open-source alternatives? EMV implementations are non-trivial and need a lot of testing and validation using specialised equipment. There need to be secure enclaves on the device to hold private keys in a way that can't easily be compromised. The app needs to interact with the phone in such a way as it can tell that biometric or PIN-based unlocks have been used so that it can vouch for user security. And the app needs to interface with card-issuing banks on the back end during setup, to get the keys and details it needs issued. An open source implementation would need to jump through a lot of hoops and set up agreements with the banks and pay for all sorts of lab verification (probably through UL). reply lxgr 17 hours agorootparent> From what I recall one of the few things that did change was raising of payment limits for these devices over contactless cards, because they are deemed more secure (can't be used by just anyone that happens to have stolen it). The limits are the same, but what these wallets added is on-device cardholder verification. In a nutshell, it lets Apple Pay tell the terminal \"the cardholder already did Face ID/Touch ID/entered their passcode; it's fine\", which can then skip PIN entry or signature collection. Other wallets do it differently and only prompt for that on-device authentication if the amount exceeds that where a PIN or signature would normally be required; yet others don't support it at all and just make you enter the PIN on the terminal (if there is any). reply karlshea 17 hours agorootparentA couple of times that lack of signature verification tripped up a cashier, they’re obviously used to always needing it with however their terminal was configured, but with Apple Pay the receipt got printed with no signature line and after looking at it funny they’re like, “oh, well here’s you’re receipt I guess you don’t need to sign!” reply lxgr 17 hours agorootparentI'm glad the cashiers in your country took it that well! I've heard of a few cases of surprised employees getting suspicious or outright hostile in the early Apple Pay days (when it wasn't available to domestic cardholders yet and only tourists would use it) This might be largely due to a strong culture of cashiers expecting to be handed over your card and them being the ones to insert it into the terminal (which is quite ridiculous – it causes the terminal to be pivoted between cashier and customer twice for each transaction for the mandatory PIN entry). reply 998244353 10 hours agorootparent> cashiers expecting to be handed over your card This is quite frustrating. I used to have a rather low limit for contactless payments. Back then, some terminals would not prompt for a PIN when the limit was exceeded and would simply decline the transaction.

Oh, in case this was not really answered in other responses ... When you add a card to an Apple or Google wallet, the wallet softwares goes off to your card issuer and asks for permission to include it in the wallet. Your card issuer may then ask you directly if it's OK and please confirm. When you have confirmed, they provide some details to your phone including some private keys (likely derived from a master) and other bits and pieces like the PAN to use, supported transaction types etc. OK, now it's set up in your phone. What happens when you tap? The terminal first goes through a sort of rapid handshake - hey, I'm a terminal, please select your default card application, let's go! Then it asks for a bunch of data - can I have your PAN, expiry, velocity data, hard and soft limits etc, please? Then it sends a bunch of data to your card - transaction type (payment, cash, refund(?)), amount, date and time, terminal type, some other bits. Your phone or card will then check these fit in with its internal rules (do I allow cash? etc), add some information (user unlocked biometrically/with PIN) arrange the data in a canonical order, hash and sign it and send back the resulting signature as a cryptogram. Part of this cryptogram will tell the terminal Yes/No to proceed and whether it needs to ask for a PIN or go online to the acquiring bank for approval. The terminal applies its own rules to the transaction as well, and can optionally downgrade the transaction from approved to online or denied, or from online to denied. If it needs to go online, it will transmit the transaction details to the acquiring (merchant's) bank, which may approve the transaction immediately or itself refer the transaction to the issuing (your) bank. It's at this point, for Apple Pay, that Apple steps into the picture - as the PAN is not the 'real' PAN, the acquiring bank refers to apple, and they then refer to the issuer. Then the approved message pops up :) Apart from the issuer-proxying, the process is basically identical if you use a phone or your physical card.

Though it's not the same on Android, you can be not-Google and do payments just fine, provided you have the same business relationships with the CC companies as a big merchant processor (good luck) Not a huge fan of Android, but Android's pretty damn open, the open advocacy orgs unfortunately tend to conflate \"you have to say \"yes\" to a dialog about untrusted apps in Android! intentionally difficult!\" with the debacle the years-long Apple stuff has turned into. I suspect we'll see less of that equivocation now that the petulance is nakedly visible, and gratefully, there's no longer billions spent on things like the \"Privacy™\" ad campaign, rushed after 100s of celebs had their nudes leaked from iCloud due to bad customer support. reply hoistbypetard 21 hours agoprevWhen Apple Pay first started to become common, I looked hard at it through the lens of my own retail payment processing experience. One of the things that impressed me most about it at the time was just how rooted in industry standards it was. None of it from the radio back was Apple-specific at all at the time, and by my read of this piece, that has held up through the present. At the time, I recall a few merchants who were intentionally accepting card-based tap-to-pay needing to alter their systems because they found themselves accidentally accepting the very standards-based Apple tap-to-pay, and they didn't want to. (CVS comes specifically to mind... IIRC they were part of a competing scheme, and they wanted the fact that their competing scheme was accepted at their retail locations to help differentiate that scheme from Apple Pay.) I'm goad the author took the time to do a more current review in this context, because when the \"only Apple Pay does this\" mythology started to emerge recently, I was scratching my head, wondering if something had changed since I had last gotten to look. reply jjcm 21 hours agoparentSharing a personal anecdote - when Apple Pay first launched, it only worked in the US. A more accurate statement though was it could only be set up in the US. I very shortly after moved to Australia, where tap-to-pay is the standard. It was kind of crazy because despite not officially being supported, Apple Pay worked everywhere in Australia. Whereas only a small handful of merchants supported it in the US, 99% of point of sales in Australia supported it because it was based off the standard. reply JimDabell 12 hours agorootparentThis also worked in reverse. When I was visiting the USA, when I tapped my credit card to pay on terminals that were seemingly set up for Apple Pay, it was mind-blowing for some people.

I had a lot of “how did you do that?” reactions from merchants when I paid for things with my phone. reply p_l 12 hours agorootparentDepends on country, and how contactless cards being the norm in many places meant there was less push among people for payment with phones, compared to USA where it seems it no modern bits for card payments happened between introduction of magnetic strip and phone-based EMV2 NFC payments. I remember changing card ~2012, in Poland, because my ancient Visa Electron with magstripe-only was confusing to new cashiers who thought lack of chip meant it's contactless. Around that time phone-based \"cards\" were also widely promoted though the tech wasn't exactly ready yet so you needed cooperation between banks and telcos to provide secure element. reply kenny11 18 hours agorootparentprevI had the same experience as you on a trip to the Netherlands. Ironically, the only place where it didn't work was the Apple store in Amsterdam. I don't know if that was an actual technical limitation, or they were aware that it was not yet available in the Netherlands and so didn't even let me try with my phone and its US credit card. reply Schiendelman 18 hours agorootparentprevI had a similar experience traveling in Europe!

Contactless payment was already becoming more prevalent, so it worked in a lot of places. reply e_y_ 3 hours agoparentprevIt was standards based, but the way Apple ran the launch and marketing (kind of genius, actually), they gave the impression that Apple Pay was the only phone-based tap-to-pay around. Merchants would have signs saying \"Apple Pay accepted\" but not mention Google, leading to confusion over whether non-Apple payments would work. Part of that is definitely the confusing state of payments on Android. Samsung Pay could refer to either NFC or magstripe-emulation. Google, of course, is terrible at branding stuff, and between Wallet and the many iterations of Google Pay it's still difficult to figure out what's what. reply tentacleuno 3 hours agorootparent> Samsung Pay could refer to either NFC or magstripe-emulation Last time I checked, you've got to swipe a magnetic-stripe card (we mainly use C&P/contactless).

Somehow it emits a magnetic pulse that simulates the card being swiped, without having to physically swipe the card. Best guess is that it uses some kind of magnetic induction to induce a current in the reader the same way that a swipe would. I never had a Samsung phone so I can't comment on how it worked in practice or the reliability.

While the DPAN is unique to a given device, the merchant's payment service provider these days can receive a unique identifier called PAR in the authorization response from the card network. That identifier is consistent across all DPANs for the same card (and aspirationally even across card number changes on the same underlying account).

However, the rest of the post still suggests that there is a unique DPAN per merchant, but I can't find any basis for that. Even Apple's own documentation at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203027 says that the DPAN (called Device Account Number here) is only unique per device. When a card is added to Apple Pay a DPAN is created for that device, and it never gets changed afterwards unless the card is removed and re-added. So whereas you can't be tracked by using the same card on two devices (e.g. iPhone and Apple Watch) because they will have two different DPANs, I'm pretty sure data brokers can track you when using the same card on the same device across different merchants. reply arcticbull 21 hours agoparent> hen a card is added to Apple Pay a DPAN is created for that device, and it never gets changed afterwards unless the card is removed and re-added.

Why is there \"Login with Google\" or \"Login with Apple\" instead of \"Login with [my default configured SSO provider]\".

RFC 8414[1] describes well-known locations to get metadata about the registration process. So the standards are there, and in theory you could have a login form where e.g. someone types their email (or the browser autofills it), and that kicks off an oauth login to that domain, doing client registration on the fly if the server has never talked to that domain before.

The communication is out-of-band, as SMTP is not an authentication protocol, so the user must perform some affirmative action (such as clicking a link in the email) to authenticate the request. With SSO, the claim that a user is authentic lies completely with the provider. If there is a bug in the implementation, a user could be authenticated when they should not be, and the actual account owner may never even be notified that such an authentication occurred. reply ndriscoll 16 hours agorootparentWith oauth/oidc, the service that's requesting the token doesn't even specify the username. What would the IdP send back if the user is not authenticated? The concern is it will just issue a token for a random user? Or that someone will break into another account on the IdP's login form? I don't see any difference with email besides convenience. If an email provider has a bug, they might allow someone else to read your email and click the link without any notification to the actual account owner that such an authentication occurred. In fact, if a provider has oauth and webmail, the two probably use the same authentication system (e.g. they use the same session cookie and login form, or the webmail might use the oauth service as its auth). Even native email clients are using oauth these days. This is a good thing. It lets you store a token with limited permission in your email client instead of storing a password for SMTP that also gives you full permissions to everything the account can do. Also most oauth implementations I've seen actually do have a dashboard in your user settings where they record which services you've provided tokens to, and what scopes those tokens have. If you're worried about CSRF, that's what the state parameter is for, and it's the consuming service that needs to use it appropriately, so you don't need to worry about whether the IdP did it right. If the IdP gives the wrong state back, the login will fail when your service checks it. reply Scarblac 20 hours agoparentprevTo support \"Login with Google\" you have to do some config on the Google side.

Even the name is usually redacted, similar to contactless and as opposed to chip or magstripe payments. All of the additional details mentioned in the article are only shared when you pay \"online\" – but that includes scanning a QR code on your phone and paying in Safari or an App Clip, which is something I've seen in a few restaurants these days. That way, the restaurant gets as much as they ask for, which can include your name, your address, and your email address.

So all the infrastructure was already there, built out by the banks themselves, when Apple came in demanding a US-style cut, as though they built the thing. The local big banks held out for years on supporting Apple Pay, before the customer pressure became too overwhelming and they relented.

Though the details of this agreement are generally confidential, it's fairly well known that there is an Apple cut, and that that cut is rather high. (It's Apple!) The moment a bank has the option to extract itself from this arrangement, it will. Not just because there's absolutely no reason to give Apple a cut of the bank's own business if the bank doesn't need to, but also because the bad blood between Aus banks and Apple is very real at this point. > Even if Apple opens up NFC payment, nobody will use them and prefer 1st party support like Apple Pay or Google Pay. And since that costs the bank money, it won't be an option. Also, I think the bank would think of itself as a first party in a payment made using their card, and Apple as a parasitic third party. I'm not saying people won't grumble, but there is no way - unless Apple actually makes Apple Pay somewhat attractive to banks - that the banks will continue to support it if they don't absolutely have to. (I'm not siding with the banks on this, I'm just trying to lay out their logic.) reply dwaite 17 hours agorootparentI think it's just different math. The 15 basis points Apple supposedly charges for with card payments from Apple Pay is meant to come from the fraud budget; that a biometric-based authentication is consider both more secure and easier to counter payment disputes. The rest comes from the convenience and hope that actually results in more card payments. In the US where there's no PIN, fraud is high. Parts of the country are still heavily cash based, so there's a good margin to gain if added convenience results in more card payments. For heavily credit card based markets with chip-and-pin, you have less fraud concerns and less to gain from convenience. My take though is that even if apple opens up the NFC chip, they aren't opening up the Secure Enclave. So even if a bank app can take over the NFC chip, they still will have secrets in memory at some point without a new P-256 based payment protocol. Unless this is a new app backed by a bank cartel, you'll also go from being able to use multiple cards to just one first-party card. This all leads to my opinion of a pretty wonky situation - opening NFC up probably increases the value of Apple Pay, since it can now be compared to other software-based wallets by users, and Apple Pay support again becomes a differentiator for the payment card. reply astrange 15 hours agorootparent> My take though is that even if apple opens up the NFC chip, they aren't opening up the Secure Enclave.

I feel like you're coming at this from the wrong angle. No one is saying Apple Pay is bad, or that the banks' solutions will be better. The question is: will banks voluntarily give up a cut to a third party intermediary, when they can roll a slightly-less-convenient-but-good-enough tech stack and keep all the money for themselves? One doesn't exactly become a top 4 bank by handing out a cut to intermediaries willy nilly.

These places can hardly manage to maintain their own apps, I have about zero confidence in them deciding to wander off into the wilderness and trying again. Not to mention, all the non-big-4, and all the smaller banks probably won’t bother with reimplementing NFC pay as they either don’t have the resources, or can’t rely on institutional-inertia to foist useless changes onto their customers. reply caf 16 hours agorootparentThe CBA Android app supports contactless, or you can add your card to the Google wallet. It seems to work equivalently well (although the enrolling bit has less friction in CBAs own app). reply inkyoto 19 hours agorootparentprev> […] we have essentially 4 big ones and they already are pretty cutting edge […] The Big Four are not the cutting edge, it is a delusion. Out of four, only the Commonwealth Wank has transitioned onto a modern core banking platform for retail banking. Business accounts still run on the legacy core banking platform, if my understanding is current and accurate. The remaining ones are as backward (from the technology POV) as they have always been. Westpac acquired St George Bank in 2008 trumpeting their core banking platform as the reason for the acquisition and the intention to transition onto it. To the best of my knowledge, that has not happened as of 2024, and Westpac contunues to use its own legacy core banking platform disjointly from that of St George's. Moreover, banking is not even integrated between the two even today, and the St George core banking has fell into a state of disrepair – EFT's can take a few days to reach the receipient's account depending on the receipient's bank. The actual – pretty much only – innovator is Macquarie Bank that has invested a lot into revamping their banking platform from the ground up, plus neo-banks – newcomers to the banking market albeit niche ones. The Big Four (or, most banks in general) loathe technology and IT as they see both as a liability, not a competitive advantage, due to tech not being their core business and due to being run by old farts with ossified brains. And that was the reason why they started rapidly losing millenials, Gen Z and other young customers to neobanks. It was a wake-up call for them. > […] instant transfers are normalized […] … and it has nothing to do with the Big Four. The Big Four, in fact, sabotaged instant payments for many years due to a lack of interest to advance the payment technology, and the instant payments in Australia only succeeded at the third (or at the fourth – I have lost the count) attempt after the Reserve Bank held the Big Four at a gunpoint and threatened them with severe penalties if they pull out again, as they had done every single time before. Instant payments in Australia are done via NPP/Osco, an independent company set up by the RBA, a BPAY subsidiary, and the Big Four as well as other local banks are mere users of it. None of the four control NPP/Osco payments, and that is a very good thing. > If the NFC chips were opened up through regulation I have zero doubt Australian banks would just say \"we support contactless with our first party app\" […] … and users would be left with the atrocious quality banking apps and with banks tracking the users all the way down into the customer's colons. User tracking was the actual reason behind the spat between the Big Four and Apple – the former wanted to get a way into users' smartphones and all sorts of device and chip ID's – to track the user behaviour to which Apple said no. As a customer, Apple's stance suits me way more. Of course, banks have found other ways to track the iPhone users courtesy of advances in the big data science, although the attempt has been somewhat hampered. The Big Four are the largest employers of data scientists and for a reason. You can't be naive and look at the Big Four through the rose tinted glasses – they are in the business of making very big money and treat their customers as acquisition assets and cows to milk. Commonwealth Wank has been onselling the transaction information to Equifax (other than reporting the credit history), and Equifax has been onselling that transaction information to some pretty shady loan shark companies. reply robertlagrant 11 hours agorootparent> and Westpac contunues to use its own legacy core banking platform disjointly from that of St George's It's so difficult to do this stuff.

It's listening for the request from an NFT reader, at which point it beams out your 'card number', and that is that. This took me a while to grok.

See jjcm's sibling comment here. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39846117 So I dare say the NFT reader isn't 'broadcasting' the amount to pay. Why would it be?

You'd be surprised! Plastic cards can do all kinds of elaborate things, like deduct that amount from an offline transaction balance, replenishing that balance the next time it gets to talk to the issuer during a chip-dipped payment (assuming the card is still in good standing), update currency conversion rate tables used abroad, maybe even play doom – but probably not all of them. reply kristjansson 16 hours agorootparent> like deduct that amount from an offline transaction balance, replenishing that balance the next time it gets to talk to the issuer during a chip-dipped payment (assuming the card is still in good standing) That deserves its own article.

Chip cards were introduced before internet connections were ubiquitous. Some cards were even explicitly offline-preferring as long as there was any offline balance remaining to save on data transmission and processing bills. There are even some fully offline chip systems around (where both terminal and card are mostly offline) that take the “offline purse” idea even further, but these are usually separate from the mostly account-based debit and credit schemes popular today, and are often getting phased out.

Offline transactions are needed whenever a transaction is made without access to the internet. Like a train in the middle of nowhere or a flight. Typically the POS just accepts the card, and then when Internet access is restored, sends them all out. So the merchant takes the risk of a customer using a bad card. But with smart functionality in the card, the card itself could make a determination of whether the payment should be approved. reply Nursie 16 hours agorootparentprev> So I dare say the NFT reader isn't 'broadcasting' the amount to pay. Why would it be? Your plastic card had no way of dealing with that information. Ah but it is, and it does :) You see those four lights that are on contactless readers? I know they're mostly meaningless to laypeople and they more or less just flash in unison to the naked eye, but they show stages of the transaction progress, left to right. There's a bunch of two-way comms going on there, including the transmission of the transaction amount, date/time, various transaction details, maybe a cryptographic challenge (nonce), and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember, from the terminal to your card. Your plastic card has an active chip on it, it's not just a dumb NFC tag, it is powered by the field the NFC reader is giving off. It does send a bunch of data to the terminal on request as an early part of the process, then receives transaction data back, arranges it with some internal bits of its own, pads, hashes and encrypts it using a key (usually a session key derived from a stored private key) and sends back the resulting cryptogram to the terminal. In fact your card makes important decisions about whether to allow the transaction to proceed, based on the transaction data, various counters and limits it maintains, etc etc. If the card doesn't approve the transaction (and show that approval in its cryptogram), the terminal cannot approve. You phone does the same stuff, but obviously without needing to use the power the reader puts out. The problem with displaying the amount before you validate, is that it would interrupt the process and require running the transaction in two halves, and it would kill the \"tap'n'go\" aspect of the transaction. But the phone can immediately display the amount afterwards. Incidentally, this sort of thing is why we have rules that the terminal must display the amount in a way that's visible to the customer, to be compliant. > It's listening for the request from an NFT reader, at which point it beams out your 'card number', and that is that.

Gruber is an open fanboi but for the most part he would at least get his facts straight and would be open about what he didn’t understand and would link to experts in the field. However, since the EU DMA actions on Apple he seems to have completely lost his objectivity. First by pretending to understand the legalese better than apparently the EC does, then by applying American lawmaking approaches to European ones which are very different and then finally by taking Apple’s bad faith statements at face value (Gruber’s turn has coincided with Apple’s very weird bad faith approach to the EU so maybe the fundamental issue is his trust in Apple). And he seems to be carrying over that to the U.S. govt’s antitrust action as well.

Some of their statements are completely incorrect and they don’t even try to address what most commenters on HN seem to care about He and Ben Thompson are very consistent.

But that’s completely irrelevant because I’m not a lawyer. Ben Thompson and Gruber are not lawyers. Lawyers I’ve followed have not found any mistakes though they do think some stuff is pushing it, but that’s completely normal and how all such cases work. You have a core case on which you add a bunch of stuff. Because, one, you expect stuff to get thrown out, but more importantly these cases are rarely litigated to the end. They’re settled. So you put more in, even the slightly weaker stuff, so you can compromise on it during negotiations. I wouldn’t have know this stuff, which is why I don’t pretend to know this stuff. Unlike Gruber and Thomson. Instead I follow lawyers online and speak to friends who are lawyers who have a better idea of what’s going on. The ridiculous part of Gruber’s assertions is because he hears about these things only when Apple is involved he seems to think they are unique or new. That’s why his insinuations in a couple of posts that the EU actions were to punish American companies and protect European ones. If he had half a clue about this area he would have known that the EU has fined way more European companies than it has companies from the rest of the world put together. reply scarface_74 20 hours agorootparentHowever, Andrew Sharp, Ben’s cohost on SharpTech was a lawyer and he also says that the judicial system is not the way to go and they should pass laws. But you don’t have to be a lawyer to know the statements of fact are in correct as far as the technology. They also condemned EUs ruling against Facebook where Facebook can’t even give users a choice of having an ad free experience by paying. I have no problem paying money for stuff I want. I think that’s an honest transaction. On Dithering, Gruber commended the EU for actually passing a simple law forcing Apple to open up NFC and the USB C mandate for iPhones instead of dragging it through some arcane legal doctrine. He didn’t necessarily agree with the law. But it was at least straightforward and honest. But even if you aren’t a lawyer - the things that most HN users care about were not addressed at all in the lawsuit. For instance there is no mention of the App Store at all except concerning NFC, cloud gaming (that Apple has already addressed) and whatever apps are called with other embedded apps. And no one in the Apple commentary community thinks the anti steering provision for Spotify and Kindle and Netflix etc is legitimate nor the former ban on cloud gaming. Right now I’m listening to the Talk Show podcast with Gruber and Jason Snell (former editor in chief of Macworld) and they aren’t giving Apple a pass at all for the three items I mentioned reply MBCook 20 hours agorootparentExcellent points. > For instance there is no mention of the App Store In fact the DOJ would have likely had issues doing that given Apple’s recent victory in that point against Epic (whatever you think of it). reply MBCook 20 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that the DOJ may be able to win the case does not make an antitrust case like this the correct way to legislate how we want companies to operate. It would be SO MUCH SIMPLER to just pass a law that says “sideloading has to be legal, easy, and free”. That’s all it would take. Or maybe “all cell phones must support RCS.” But not only have we not done that, the lawsuit against Apple for being a monopoly on the App Store was won by Apple. A court said they are legally in the clear. Apple already said they were adding RCS before this whole thing started. So the DOJ has come up with a bunch of issues, some of which that don’t even seem relevant anymore, in an attempt to draw out concessions from Apple in a settlement to get what they couldn’t get through previous court cases. Or perhaps win a verdict and charge them a whole bunch of money for stuff that doesn’t matter all that much because again, some of the stuff they seem to be really mad about Apple already won on in another trial. The DOJ is supposed to be about enforcement, not creating the laws. This is not how this process should be working. And as Gruber and others have pointed out, if you have to twist a bunch of hundred plus year-old laws to try to come up with a case to do something that could’ve been done with a single stroke of a pen… maybe that’s what you should’ve done instead. I haven’t seen anyone saying who is arguing that Apple should 100% get out of all of this and they’re not doing anything wrong. Gruber and many others in the app world have been saying for years that Apple’s blatant greed is going to get them a smack down, and they’ll lose some of their good policies along with the bad. People are arguing that the lawsuit doesn’t seem well-made and that it shouldn’t how the government accomplishes its goals in the first place anyway. reply hedora 18 hours agorootparentLaws like you propose tend to age poorly. RCS is incredibly consumer-hostile (e.g., there is no end to end encryption unless you use Google’s data-harvesting stack on both sides). Similarly, requiring side loading could preclude new classes of devices. Usually, the laws are written more vaguely for this reason. I think the big change we need to make is to say that anti-trust laws apply whenever N or fewer organizations control over X% of the market. I think N=3 and 75% would be good starting points. Among other things, this would open up licensing and cell plans on 5G modems. It would also mean that the google app store and apple app store both have monopolies over cell phone software resale and distribution. (Google’s “android is open source and supports side loading” argument wouldn’t matter in such a regime, unless that meant that consumers and device manufacturers could reasonably expect degoogled android to actually run android apps and stuff, and that over a quarter of the market actually did so). reply scarface_74 16 hours agorootparent> Laws like you propose tend to age poorly.

If you can’t argue the EU ruling is bad (and not because Apple is greedy or shortsighted etc), you are missing something. Apple has a vision - the EU has a vision and they do not align. The EU is poor. It has been mismanaging itself for years: they should be doing better than they are. Is this caused by outside vectors or the leadership, or maybe the structure (too many cooks in EU kitchen)? Is the vision of the world the EU wants 15-25 years out strong? Is the world the EU would create good for the EU - 30 years out? I’d argue it’d be a comfortable one. But a poor and weaker one. I’m not trying to defend Apple. I’m trying to say that the EU leadership is likely bad - my hunch is anyone truly good would work in the state department of the respective nation.

    "originBody": "Dioxus 0.5: Signal Rewrite, Remove lifetimes, CSS Hotreloading, and more! March 28, 2024 @jkelleyrtp, @ealmloff The story Here at Dioxus Labs, we have an unofficial rule: only one rewrite per year. Our last rewrite brought some amazing features: templates, hotreloading, and insane performance. However, don’t be mistaken, rewrites are scary, time consuming, and a huge gamble. We started this new rewrite on January 1st of 2024, completed it by Feburary 1st, and then spent another month and a half writing tests, squashing bugs, and polishing documentation. Rewrites are absolutely not for the faint of heart. If you’re new here, Dioxus (dye•ox•us) is a library for building GUIs in Rust. Originally, I built Dioxus as a rewrite of Yew with the intention of supporting proper server-side-rendering. Eventually, Dioxus got popular, we got some amazing sponsors, and I went full time. We’ve grown from a team of 1 (me) to a team of 4(!) - pulled entirely from the wonderful dioxus community. Now, Dioxus is something a little different. Real life, actual companies are shipping web apps, desktop apps, and mobile apps with Dioxus. What was once just a fun little side project powers a small fraction of apps out in the wild. We now have lofty goals of simplifying the entire app development ecosystem. Web, Desktop, Mobile, all end-to-end typesafe, blazing fast, living under one codebase. The dream! With 0.5 we took a hard look at how Dioxus would need to change to achieve those goals. The request we got from the community was clear: make it simpler, make it robust, make it polished. What’s new? This is probably the biggest release of Dioxus ever, with so many new features, bug fixes, and improvements that I can’t list them all. We churned over 100,000 lines of code (yes, 100,000+) with over 1,400 commits between 0.4.3 and 0.5.0. Here’s a quick overview: Complete rewrite of dioxus-core, removing all unsafe code Abandoning use_state and use_ref for a clone-free Signal-based API Removal of all lifetimes and the cx: Scope state A single, unified launch function that starts your app for any platform Asset hotreloading that supports Tailwind and Vanilla CSS Rewrite of events, allowing access to the native WebSys event types Extension of components with element properties (IE a Link now takes all ofproperties) Integrated Error Boundaries and Server Futures with Suspense integration 5x faster desktop reconciliation and custom asset handlers for streaming bytes Streaming server functions and fullstack hotreloading Tons of QoL improvements, bug fixes, and more! 💡 If you are updating from DIoxus 0.4, a migration guide is available Lifetime Problems To make Dioxus simpler, we wanted to remove lifetimes entirely. Newcomers to rust are easily scared off by lifetime issues, and even experienced Rustaceans find wading through obtuse error messages exhausting. In dioxus 0.1-0.4, every value in a component lives for a 'bump lifetime. This lifetime lets you easily use hooks, props and the scope within event listeners without cloning anything. It was the chief innovation that made Dioxus so much easier to use than Yew when it was released. // Scope and Element have the lifetime 'bump fn OldDioxusComponent(cx: Scope) -> Element { // hook has the lifetime 'bump let mut state = use_state(cx, || 0); cx.render(rsx! { button { // The closure has the lifetime 'bump which means you don't // need to clone hook before you move it into the closure onclick: move |_event| *state += 1, } }) } Rust Copy This works great for hooks most of the time. The lifetime lets you omit a bunch of manual clones every time you want to use a value inside an EventHandler (onclick, oninput, etc). However, the lifetime doesn’t work for futures. Futures in dioxus need to be 'static which means you always need to clone values before you use them in the future. Since a future might need to run while the component is rendering, it can’t share the component’s lifetime. // Scope and Element have the lifetime 'bump fn OldDioxusComponent(cx: Scope) -> Element { // state has the lifetime 'bump let state = use_state(cx, || 0); cx.spawn({ // Because state has the lifetime 'bump, we need to clone it to make it // 'static before we move it into the 'static future let state = state.clone(); async move { println!(\"{state}\"); } }); // ... } Rust Copy If you don’t clone the value, you will run into an error like this: 4fn OldDioxusComponent(cx: Scope) -> Element {--|`cx` is a reference that is only valid in the function bodyhas type `&'1 Scoped` ... 8/ cx.spawn(async move { 9| println!(\"{state}\"); 10| });| ^|| |______`cx` escapes the function body hereargument requires that `'1` must outlive `'static` Rust Copy The error complains that cx must outlive 'static without mentioning the hook at all which can be very confusing. Dioxus 0.5 fixes this issue by first removing scopes and the 'bump lifetime and then introducing a new Copy state management solution called signals. Here is what the component looks like in dioxus 0.5: // Element has no lifetime, and you don't need a Scope fn NewComponent() -> Element { // state is 'static and Copy, even if the inner value you store is not Copy let mut state = use_signal(|| 0); // State is already 'static and Copy, so it is copied into the future automatically spawn(async move { println!(\"{state}\"); }); rsx! { button { // The closure has the lifetime 'static, but state is copy so you don't need to clone into the closure onclick: move |_event| state += 1, } } } Rust Copy While this might seem like a rather innocuous change, it has an impressively huge impact on how easy it is to write new components. I’d say building a new Dioxus app is about 2-5x easier with this change alone. Goodbye scopes and lifetimes! In the new version of dioxus, scopes and the 'bump lifetime have been removed! This makes declaring a component and using runtime functions within that component much easier: You can now declare a component by just accepting your props directly instead of a scope parameter #[component] fn MyComponent(name: String) -> Element { rsx! { \"Hello {name}!\" } } Rust Copy And inside that component, you can use runtime functions directly spawn(async move { tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await; // You can even use runtime functions inside futures and event handlers! let context: i32 = consume_context(); }); Rust Copy Now that lifetimes are gone, Elements are 'static which means you can use them in hooks or even provide them through the context API. This makes some APIs like virtual lists in dioxus significantly easier. We expect more interesting APIs to emerge from the community now that you don’t need to be a Rust wizard to implement things like virtualization and offscreen rendering. Removal of all Unsafe in Core Removing the 'bump lifetime along with the scope gave us a chance to remove a lot of unsafe from dioxus. dioxus-core 0.5 contains no unsafe code 🎉 There’s still a tiny bit of unsafe floating around various dependencies that we plan to remove throughout the 0.5 release cycle, but way less: all quite simple to cut or unfortunately necessary due to FFI. Signals! Dioxus 0.5 introduces Signals as the core state primitive for components. Signals have two key advantages over the existing use_state and use_ref hooks: They are always Copy and they don’t require manual subscriptions. Copy state Signal is Copy, even if the inner T values is not. This is enabled by our new generational-box crate (implemented with zero unsafe). Signals can even optionally be Send+Sync if you need to move them between threads, removing the need for a whole class of specialized state management solutions. The combination of Copy + Send + Sync Signals, and static components makes it incredibly easy to move state to anywhere you need it: fn Parent() -> Element { // We use a sync signal here so that we can use it in other threads, // but you could use a normal signal if you have !Send data let mut state = use_signal_sync(|| 0); spawn(async move { // Signals have a ton of helper methods that make them easy to work with. // You can call a signal like a function to get the current value let value: i32: state(); }); // Because signals can be sync, we can copy them into threads easily std::thread::spawn(move || { loop { std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)); println!(\"{state}\"); } }); rsx! { button { // You can easily move it into an event handler just like use_state onclick: move |_| state += 1 } } } Rust Copy With Copy state, we’ve essentially bolted on a light form of garbage collection into Rust that uses component lifecycles as the triggers for dropping state. From a memory perspective, this is basically the same as 0.4, but with the added benefit of not needing to explicitly Clone anything. Smarter subscriptions Signals are smarter about what components rerun when they are changed. A component will only rerun if you read the value of the signal in the component (not in an async task or event handler). In this example, only the child will re-render when the button is clicked because only the child component is reading the signal: fn Parent() -> Element { let mut state = use_signal(|| 0); rsx! { button { onclick: move |_| state += 1, \"increment\" } Child { state } } } #[component] fn Child(state: Signal) -> Element { rsx! { \"{state}\" } } Rust Copy Smarter subscriptions let us merge several different hooks into signals. For example, we were able to remove an entire crate dedicated to state management: Fermi. Fermi provided what was essentially a use_state API where statics were used as keys. This meant you could declare some global state, and then read it in your components: static COUNT: Atom = Atom::new(|| 0); fn Demo(cx: Scope) -> Element { let mut count = use_read_atom(cx, &COUNT); rsx! { \"{count}\" } } Rust Copy Since fermi didn’t support smart subscriptions, you had to explicitly declare use the right use_read/ use_write hooks to subscribe to the value. In Dioxus 0.5, we just use signals, eliminating the need for any sort of external state management solution altogether. // You can use a lazily initialized signal called // GlobalSignal in static instead of special Fermi atoms static COUNT: GlobalSignal = Signal::global(|| 0); // Using the GlobalSignal is just the same as any other signal! // No need for use_read or use_write fn Demo() -> Element { rsx! { \"{COUNT}\" } } Rust Copy Signals even work with the context API, so you can quickly share state between components in your app: fn Parent() -> Element { // Create a new signal and provide it to the context API // without a special use_shared_state hook let mut state = use_context_provider(|| Signal::new(0)); rsx! { button { onclick: move |_| state += 1, \"Increment\" } Child {} } } fn Child() -> Element { // Get the state from the context API let state = use_context::>(); rsx! { \"{state}\" } } Rust Copy Smart subscriptions also apply to hooks. Hooks like use_future and use_memo will now automatically add signals you read inside the hook to the dependencies of the hook: // You can use a lazily initialized signal called GlobalSignal in static instead of special Fermi atoms static COUNT: GlobalSignal = Signal::global(|| 0); fn App() -> Element { // Because we read COUNT inside the memo, it is automatically added to the memo's dependencies // If we change COUNT, then the memo knows it needs to rerun let memo = use_memo(move || COUNT() / 2); rsx! { \"{memo}\" } } Rust Copy CSS Hot Reloading As part of our asset system overhaul, we implemented hotreloading of CSS files in the asset directory. If a CSS file appears in your RSX, the dx CLI will watch that file and immediately stream its updates to the running app. This works for web, desktop, and fullstack, with mobile support coming in a future mobile-centric update. When combined with the Tailwind watcher, we now support hotreloading of Tailwind CSS! On top of that, we also support IDE hinting of Tailwind classes in VSCode with a custom regex extension What’s even niftier is that you can stream these changes to several devices at once, unlocking simultaneous hotreloading across all devices that you target: Event System Rewrite Since it’s release, dioxus has used a synthetic event system to create a cross platform event API. Synthetic events can be incredibly useful to make events work across platforms and even serialize them across the network, but they do have some drawbacks. Dioxus 0.5 finally exposes the underlying event type for each platform along with a trait with a cross platform API. This has two advantages: You can get whatever information you need from the platform event type or pass that type to another library: fn Button() -> Element { rsx! { button { onclick: move |event| { let web_sys_event: web_sys::MouseEvent = event.web_event(); web_sys::console::log_1(&web_sys_event.related_target.into()); } } } } Rust Copy Dioxus can bundle split code for events apps don’t use. For a hello world example, this shrinks the gzipped size ~25%! Again, this seems like a small change on the surface, but opens up dozens of new use cases and possible libraries you can build with dioxus. 💡 The Dioxus optimization guide has tips to help you make the smallest possible bundle Cross platform launch Dioxus 0.5 introduces a new cross platform API to launch your app. This makes it easy to target multiple platforms with the same application. Instead of pulling in a separate renderer package, you can now enable a feature on the dioxus crate and call the launch function from the prelude: [dependencies] dioxus = \"0.5\" [features] default = [] desktop = [\"dioxus/desktop\"] fullstack = [\"dioxus/fullstack\"] server = [\"dioxus/axum\"] web = [\"dioxus/web\"] TOML Copy use dioxus::prelude::*; fn main() { dioxus::launch(|| rsx!{ \"hello world\" }) } Rust Copy With that single application, you can easily target: # Desktop dx serve --platform desktop # SPA web dx serve --platform web # Or a fullstack application dx serve --platform fullstack Bash Copy The CLI is now smart enough to automatically pass in the appropriate build features depending on the platform you’re targeting. Asset System Beta Currently assets in dioxus (and web applications in general) can be difficult to get right. Links to your asset can easily get out of date, the link to your asset can be different between desktop and web applications, and you need to manually add assets you want to use into your bundled application. In addition to all of that, assets can be a huge performance bottleneck. Lets take a look at the dioxus mobile guide in the docsite as an example: The 0.4 mobile guide takes 7 seconds to load and transfers 9 MB of resources. The page has 6 different large image files which slows down the page loading times significantly. We could switch to a more optimized image format like avif , but manually converting every screenshot is tedious and time consuming. Lets take a look at the 0.5 mobile guide with the new asset system: The new mobile guide takes less than 1 second to load and requires only 1/3 of the resources with the exact same images! Dioxus 0.5 introduces a new asset system called manganis. Manganis integrates with the CLI to check, bundle and optimize assets in your application. The API is currently unstable so the asset system is currently published as a separate crate. In the new asset system, you can just wrap your assets in the mg! macro and they will automatically be picked up by the CLI. You can read more about the new asset system in the manganis docs. As we continue to iterate on the 0.5 release, we plan to add hot reloading to manganis assets, so you can interactively add new the features to your app like CSS, images, tailwind classes, and more without forcing a complete reload. 5x Faster Desktop Rendering Dioxus implements several optimizations to make diffing rendering fast. Templates let dioxus skip diffing on any static parts of the rsx macro. However, diffing is only one side of the story. After you create a list of changes you need to make to the DOM, you need to apply them. We developed sledgehammer for dioxus web to make applying those mutations as fast as possible. It makes manipulating the DOM from Rust almost as fast as native JavaScript. In dioxus 0.5, we apply that same technique to apply changes across the network as fast as possible. Instead of using json to communicate changes to the desktop and liveview renderers, dioxus 0.5 uses a binary protocol. For render intensive workloads, the new renderer takes only 1/5 the time to apply the changes in the browser with 1/2 the latency. Here is one of the benchmarks we developed while working on the new binary protocol. In dioxus 0.4, the renderer was constantly freezing. In dioxus 0.5, it runs smoothly: Dioxus 0.4 Dioxus 0.5 Spreading props One common pattern when creating components is providing some additional functionality to a specific element. When you wrap an element, it is often useful to provide some control over what attributes are set in the final element. Instead of manually copying over each attribute from the element, dioxus 0.5 supports extending specific elements and spreading the attributes into an element: #[derive(Props, PartialEq, Clone)] struct Props { // You can extend a specific element or global attributes #[props(extends = img)] attributes: Vec, } fn ImgPlus(props: Props) -> Element { rsx! { // You can spread those attributes into any element img { ..props.attributes } } } fn app() -> Element { rsx! { ImgPlus { // You can use any attributes you would normally use on the img element width: \"10px\", height: \"10px\", src: \"https://example.com/image.png\", } } } Rust Copy Shorthand attributes Another huge quality-of-life feature we added was the ability to use shorthand struct initialization syntax to pass attributes into elements and components. We got tired of passing class: class everywhere and decided to finally implement this long awaited feature, at the expense of some code breakage. Now, it’s super simple to declare attributes from props: #[component] fn ImgPlus(class: String, id: String, src: String) -> Element { rsx! { img { class, id, src } } } Rust Copy This feature works for anything implementing IntoAttribute, meaning signals also benefit from shorthand initialization. While signals as attributes don’t yet skip diffing, we plan to add this as a performance optimization throughout the 0.5 release cycle. Multi-line attribute merging Another amazing feature added this cycle was attribute merging. When working with libraries like tailwind, you’ll occasionally want to make certain attributes conditional. Before, you had to format the attribute using an empty string. Now, you can simply add an extra attribute with a conditional, and the attribute will be merged using a space as a delimiter: #[component] fn Blog(enabled: bool) -> Element { rsx! { div { class: \"bg-gray-200 border rounded shadow\", class: if enabled { \"text-white\" } } } } Rust Copy This is particularly important when using libraries like tailwind where attributes need to be parsed at compile time but also dynamic at runtime. This syntax integrates with the tailwind compiler, removing the runtime overhead for libraries like tailwind-merge. Server function streaming Dioxus 0.5 supports the latest version of the server functions crate which supports streaming data. Server functions can now choose to stream data to or from the client. This makes it easier to do a whole class of tasks on the server. Creating a streaming server function is as easy as defining the output type and returning a TextStream from the server function. Streaming server functions are great for updating the client during any long running task. We built an AI text generation example here: https://github.com/ealmloff/dioxus-streaming-llm that uses Kalosm and local LLMS to serve what is essentially a clone of OpenAI’s ChatGPT endpoint on commodity hardware. #[server(output = StreamingText)] pub async fn mistral(text: String) -> Result { let text_generation_stream = todo!(); Ok(TextStream::new(text_generation_stream)) } Rust Copy Side note, the AI metaframework used here - Kalosm - is maintained by the Dioxus core team member ealmloff, and his AI GUI app Floneum is built with Dioxus! Fullstack CLI platform The CLI now supports a fullstack platform with hot reloading and parallel builds for the client and sever. You can now serve your fullstack app with the dx command: dx serve # Or with an explicit platform dx serve --platform fullstack Bash Copy Liveview router support https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/pull/1505 @DonAlonzo added liveview support for the router in dioxus 0.5. The router will now work out of the box with your liveview apps! Custom Asset Handlers https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/pull/1719 @willcrichton added support for custom asset handlers to dioxus desktop. Custom asset handlers let you efficiently stream data from your rust code into the browser without going through javascript. This is great for high bandwidth communication like video streaming: Now, you can do things like work with gstreamer or webrtc and pipe data directly into the webview without needing to encode/decode frames by hand. Native File Handling This is a bit smaller of a tweak, but now we properly support file drops for desktop: Previously we just gave you the option to intercept filedrops but now it’s natively integrated into the event system Error handling Error handling: You can use error boundaries and the throw trait to easily handle errors higher up in your app Dioxus provides a much easier way to handle errors: throwing them. Throwing errors combines the best parts of an error state and early return: you can easily throw an error with ?, but you keep information about the error so that you can handle it in a parent component. You can call throw on any Result type that implements Debug to turn it into an error state and then use ? to return early if you do hit an error. You can capture the error state with an ErrorBoundary component that will render the a different component if an error is thrown in any of its children. fn Parent() -> Element { rsx! { ErrorBoundary { handle_error: |error| rsx! { \"Oops, we encountered an error. Please report {error} to the developer of this application\" }, ThrowsError {} } } } fn ThrowsError() -> Element { let name: i32 = use_hook(|| \"1.234\").parse().throw()?; todo!() } Rust Copy You can even nest ErrorBoundary components to capture errors at different levels of your app. fn App() -> Element { rsx! { ErrorBoundary { handle_error: |error| rsx! { \"Hmm, something went wrong. Please report {error} to the developer\" }, Parent {} } } } fn Parent() -> Element { rsx! { ErrorBoundary { handle_error: |error| rsx! { \"The child component encountered an error: {error}\" }, ThrowsError {} } } } fn ThrowsError() -> Element { let name: i32 = use_hook(|| \"1.234\").parse().throw()?; todo!() } Rust Copy This pattern is particularly helpful whenever your code generates a non-recoverable error. You can gracefully capture these \"global\" error states without panicking or handling state for each error yourself. Hotreloading by default and “develop” mode for desktop We shipped hotreloading in 0.3, added it to desktop in 0.4, and now we’re finally enabling it by default in 0.5. By default, when you dx serve your app, hotreloading is enabled in development mode. Additionally, we’ve drastically improved the developer experience of building desktop apps. When we can’t hotreload the app and have to do a full recompile, we now preserve the state of the open windows and resume that state. This means your app won’t block your entire screen on every edit and it will maintain its size and position, leading to a more magical experience. Once you’ve played with it, you can never go back - it’s that good. Updates to the dioxus template With this update, our newest core team member Miles put serious work into overhauling documentation and our templates. We now have templates to create new dioxus apps for web, desktop, mobile, tui, and fullstack under one command. We also updated the default app you get when using dx new to be closer to the traditional create-react-app. The template is now seeded with assets, CSS, and some basic deploy configuration. Plus, it includes links to useful resources like dioxus-std, the VSCode Extension, docs, tutorials, and more. Dioxus-Community and Dioxus-std The Dioxus Community is something special: discord members marc and Doge have been hard at working updating important ecosystem crates for the 0.5 release. With this release, important crates like icons, charts, and the dioxus-specific standard library are ready to use right out the gate. The Dioxus Community project is a new GitHub organization that keeps important crates up-to-date even when the original maintainers step down. If you build a library for Dioxus, we’ll be happy to help maintain it, keeping it at what is essentially “Tier 2” support. Coming soon At a certain point we had to stop adding new features to this release. There’s plenty of cool projects on the horizon: Stabilizing and more deeply integrating the asset system Bundle splitting the outputted .wasm directly - with lazy components Islands and resumable interactivity (serializing signals!) Server components and merging LiveView into fullstack Enhanced Devtools (potentially featuring some AI!) and testing framework Complete mobile overhaul Fullstack overhaul with websockets, SSE, progressive forms, and more Sneak Peek: Dioxus-Blitz revival using Servo We’re not going to say much about this now, but here’s a sneak peek at “Blitz 2.0”… we’re finally integrating servo into blitz so you can render natively with WGPU using the same CSS engine that powers Firefox. To push this effort forward, we’ve brought the extremely talented Nico Burns (the wizard behind our layout library Taffy) on full time. More about this later, but here’s a little demo of google.com being rendered at 900 FPS entirely on the GPU: Admittedly the current iteration is not quite there (google.com is in fact a little wonky) but we’re progressing rapidly here and are quickly approaching something quite usable. The repo is here if you want to take a look and get involved: https://github.com/jkelleyrtp/stylo-dioxus How can you contribute? Well, that’s it for the new features. We might’ve missed a few things (there’s so much new!). If you find Dioxus as exciting as we do, we’d love your help to completely transform app development. We’d love contributions including: Translating docs into your native language Attempting “Good First Issues” Improving our documentation Contributing to the CLI Help answer questions from the discord community That’s it! We’re super grateful for the community support and excited for the rest of 2024. Build cool things! ✌",

With these 0.5 changes the Dioxus authors remove almost all the complexities that I ran into when working on Ebou. I haven't played around with it yet, but the removal of lifetimes and constant cloning will make it a much more pleasant experience. I'm looking forward to trying it out, congratulations to the team for such an awesome release! [1]: https://github.com/terhechte/Ebou reply ryukoposting 1 hour agoparent> in general a good experience, but it was also clear that lots of things were still missing I'll second that. I was working on a GUI frontend for sshfs in Dioxus about 9 months ago. My impression was that it's a really, really good GUI framework... until you run into a wall because the developers aren't finished with some feature yet. Sharing state across different contexts can also be a pain sometimes, but that's true of every GUI framework I've ever used, regardless of language or underlying technologies. Dioxus 0.5 looks like a big leap forward in this regard. My blog uses Dioxus to render a sizable portion of its HTML. In that use case, its limits aren't pushed, and it does a wonderful job. reply echelon 5 hours agoparentprevHow did you choose Dioxus? There are about a dozen Rust frameworks [1] that are trying to do the \"native, reactive UI\" you can deploy on desktop, web/wasm, mobile, etc. I'm worried about betting on the wrong horse and being stuck maintaining abandonware or being faced with a painful and pointless migration. In a similar evolutionary race, there were dozens of Rust HTTP server frameworks. Now Axum, Actix, and Rocket appear to have the lead. I'm worried I made the wrong choice as the community momentum appears to be shifting to Axum. Is there any indication Dioxus will win? It looks to have a large community, venture backing [2] (a good sign!), and more momentum than some of the others. I'd like to use one of these frameworks now, but I worry it's too early to place a bet. Are there any good indicators that now is a good time to start using it? Are Leptos and Yew the other top contenders? These are the two names I hear the most, apart from Dioxus. What would make them a better (or worse) choice? My company is heavily invested in Rust, Actix, and Bevy. We're looking at pairing Bevy with Dioxus or a similar framework to deliver native desktop and mobile clients in the future. I just want to make the right choice. Also, stupid question: is Dioxus named after the Pokemon [3]? The logo makes me think there's something to that, but there are no Pokemon references in the codebase.

Yew has had about 10 commits in the past 6 months and the original creator has since moved on. Leptos is a good solution for web-app type stuff, but IMO there's a big usability gap. I'll let the community be the judge there, but I wrote up some differences here: https://github.com/dioxusLabs/dioxus/?tab=readme-ov-file#dio... Leptos was fortunate enough to receive a lot of attention from youtubers on its launch. The most important thing here: we raised venture money for Dioxus. We have many years of runway, are pretty lean, and exclusively focused on pouring resources into making the best GUI library for Rust (and potentially branching out to Python/JS). Getting into YC isn't easy, raising money isn't easy, and there's currently no other Rust projects with similar goals, talent, and financial backing. Biased of course. Oh, and we're committed to the bevy integration. bevy_dioxus is already updated for 0.5 and we share corporate sponsors with the bevy folks. Final point, legally, no we're not inspired by any pokemon with a similar sounding name. Even though that pokemon is awesome. reply dorian-graph 4 hours agorootparent> The most important thing here: we raised venture money for Dioxus. Important, but in a _bad_ way? What will the VC expect out of Dioxus? How will you make money? reply jkelleyrtp 4 hours agorootparentVenture doesn't necessarily mean bad. Long term the goal the goal is to dissolve the gates to Apple and Google's walled gardens, which I personally believe is a net good. As much is the idealist in me wants to do that with no venture backing, the realist in me knows we need Dioxus to be self sustaining and providing legitimate value for people to switch. Google spends 76 million dollars a year on catering alone - there's no way you can compete with Android and Flutter without huge resources. Apple and Google capture the value for their platforms via fees and lock-in. Our goal is to capture value by providing really good utilities for building and deploying apps. You can't move heaven and earth without a really big lever, and venture gives us more leverage. reply steveklabnik 4 hours agorootparentIf you don't mind me asking, what's the actual business model here? Are you going to charge for those utilities? reply jkelleyrtp 3 hours agorootparentYes, we're looking at something like a Vercel/Expo model, probably built on Fly, Cloudflare, or AWS, but designed to be self hosted. We've got a decent amount of enterprise adoption and I think there's money to be made by selling something like a self-hosted Vercel. TBD on licensing - I'd want it to be open source but we wouldn't want people reselling our deploy platform. We raised a seed to prove that people want to build with dioxus. If that hypotheses is validated, then we invest in the deploy model. If not, we have OSS grants and corporate sponsors that will keep the project alive for years even if the VC money runs out. I'm not super interested in making money at the hobbyist tier - those developers are our evangelists. Enterprise self hosting is likely harder but I think we can provide a lot of value to teams building apps in large companies. reply steveklabnik 3 hours agorootparentNeat, thank you! reply SkyMarshal 3 hours agorootparentprevSpeaking of Flutter, that and Electron seem to be the only really mature multi-platform build systems. What is Dioxus's competitive proposition vs those two? The performance and memory efficiency+safety of Rust is one, any others? reply jkelleyrtp 3 hours agorootparentI'd add React-Native / expo to your list. Flutter is written in Dart but renders to a canvas on the web making it a very, very poor choice for web apps. Especially backend/fullstack apps. Plus you can't use tailwind or whatever flavor of css library there is today. Flutter just nailed the \"get up and running\" part which we've got as well: `cargo binstall dioxus-cli`, `dx new`, `dx bundle` is literally less than 30 seconds. Hopefully `dx deploy` coming soon. Electron is... it's electron. A whole chromium instance, an IPC bridge between your frontend and the system, NodeJS, etc. If you compile for size, our desktop apps are 3mb. You can easily deploy them on an embedded/low end device. We're hoping to eat some market share in the embedded-ish land (not true embedded, but like industrial or POS). Dioxus also has mobile and desktop compatible server functions which basically no other projects have. Expo has been kinda exploring this space. One of our examples is deploying your own LLM on your own infrastructure with a dioxus mobile app UI and it fits in a single file and builds in under a minute. reply SkyMarshal 33 minutes agorootparentThanks, wasn't aware of Expo, though it seems to only do mobile+web apps but not desktop apps? > If you compile for size, our desktop apps are 3mb. I'm aware of this from familiarity with Tauri, but hearing it again still amazes me. Very cool. I have an app in mind I want to build, and really would like to have standalone versions on Android+iOS+Linux+Mac+Windows, plus a web app. But there's no way I can manage all that as a single developer. And the fact no development tool has really nailed this yet is telling how hard it is. Whoever really gets this right will save a ton of developer hours across the industry, and that's valuable. Good luck, hope you guys pull it off! PS - one feature request: a local/offline-first mode that eases development of apps that work even with poor or no internet connection. Basically I want to build something like Obsidian that is multi-platform, and does all processing and data storage locally first, then syncs with the cloud when available, with as few developer resources as possible. A tool that could enable that would be amazing. reply azemetre 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it's becoming more common in my group of SWEs to specifically opt to NOT use VC backed software. Everyone has stories about companies closing shop and projects failing to continue onward. Why would Dioxus be any different? If VC's cared about tearing down walled gardens of Google and Apple, why not explicitly donate the money instead? Why have strings attached at all? reply nemothekid 3 hours agorootparentFor a GUI based project, I'd actually prefer they were VC and/or corporate backed with clear governance. OSS backend libraries are easily forked, and someone is usually willing to hack on a database library, but GUIs tend to be boring to work on, and designers don't tend to have to the same gumption to work for free that developers do. reply jkelleyrtp 3 hours agorootparentprevWe have grants and corporate sponsors to keep the project alive even if the VC money runs out. This was all a side project for me at first, so I went down the \"donation\" route in the beginning. Donations are great but they're not how the system works, unfortunately. Dioxus could never compete with the two most valuable companies on earth if it wasn't a self-sustaining business. VC just lets me scale the team from 2 people to 10(?) and have some cash to iterate. We were \"profitable\" even before taking venture money. Now we're able to take on more moonshot-type projects like the blitz renderer, a deploy platform, UI fuzz tooling, and more. We're using our seed round exclusively to make dioxus as awesome as possible, so even if it doesn't work out at a venture level, there's still a really cool, polished, end-to-end app framework that you can build and ship with in Rust. reply azemetre 2 hours agorootparentThat's fair and you're welcome to chart your own path, but I like what Tauri does with their governance model: https://dracc.commonsconservancy.org/0035/ https://tauri.app/about/governance Just for me personally, I don't see the financialization of open source software as an intrinsic good thing and I reflect my technology choices to support this when applicable. reply jkelleyrtp 2 hours agorootparentWe'll probably explore that in the future but right now our team is literally just 2.5 fulltime engineers. Tauri is seeking monetization via CrabNebula, but I can see how the governance structure would secure more confidence in the OSS side. http://crabnebula.dev reply riku_iki 3 hours agorootparentprev> it's becoming more common in my group of SWEs to specifically opt to NOT use VC backed software so, what they use instead? Bugged, dead OSS dropped by creators?.. reply azemetre 2 hours agorootparentNo, normal OSS whose existence isn't tied to VC mostly. It's not like a hard/fast rule, just a heuristic. reply riku_iki 1 hour agorootparentThere are very few good quality, stable, active OSS projects which is not fed by VC/corps money. In this case (UI for rust) there is no much choice. reply fabrice_d 53 minutes agorootparentFunding by VC and funding by corps sponsors are 2 very different things. Check how linux desktop projects such as Gnome & KDE kept the lights on for >20 years without VC funding. reply wpietri 3 hours agorootparentprev\"There are more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\" reply riku_iki 3 hours agorootparentprev> What will the VC expect out of Dioxus? there are several ways to monetize: - consultancy - \"Pro\" extensions on top of OSS core reply yencabulator 1 hour agorootparentConsultancy is unlikely to give VC a 100x return. Enterprise extensions means the cursed land of open core and refusing to have features in the open source version, or a heavy SaaS push combined with a possible license change along the road, and these are the primary reasons to avoid VC-backed \"open source for now\". reply riku_iki 31 minutes agorootparent> Enterprise extensions means the cursed land of open core and refusing to have features in the open source version yes, there are risks in exchange of VC money. You can branch your \"Libre\" project any time, and continue building on top of infra developed using VC funds and which you get for free. But what are other choices? reply unshavedyak 3 hours agorootparentprev> Oh, and we're committed to the bevy integration. bevy_dioxus is already updated for 0.5 and we share corporate sponsors with the bevy folks. I checked out the crate and am still a bit confused. If i may, is it a goal of bevy_dioxus to allow standard bevy gamedev but with the UI portion handled by dioxus? reply jkelleyrtp 3 hours agorootparentYes, a big feature bevy is lacking is a decent editor. There's been an ongoing push to get dioxus into bevy to accelerate the editor development. Bevy's ECS model is good for games but hasn't been cleanly mapped into the traditional GUI space yet. Dioxus is composable so you can integrate it at multiple levels. The bevy folks are using our virtualdom plus state management with their own renderer. reply earthling8118 4 hours agorootparentprevAxum is certainly where it is at and where it has been for a while in terms of HTTP server frameworks. I'd say actix is in second place for sure, but it is wholly viable regardless. Rocket is no longer in the running as far as I'm concerned, and it hasn't been for quite some time. Dioxus is certainly taking the head spot in front end. I still have more concern about the venture backing than I have confidence about it, but for better or for worse, it is certainly the best attempt at this so far. I enjoyed yew as a react-style framework, but its development is slow. Dioxus has made a lot of progress, and in my experience, it is currently the best experience that can be had. It's hard to say if now is the correct time, but I'd be watching it closely if I were you. There's been major work to improve the framework with many of the interfaces changing. Now might be a good time because of the progress made here, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were more changes in store. Although I imagine that you're used to that from bevy anyway. reply cchance 5 hours agorootparentprevI'd say leptos and dioxus are the bigger ones now i feel like many people moved from ywe to those 2 reply sanity 2 hours agoprevI just picked Dioxus to build a decentralized homepage for Freenet[1], it will be the first decentralized website people see when they get Freenet set up. It reminds me a bit of my Kotlin web framework called Kweb[2] that I've been working on on-and-off for a few years now, particularly the way it handles state and the DSL that maps from code to HTML. So far I like what I see. [1] https://freenet.org/ [2] https://kweb.io/ reply jkelleyrtp 2 hours agoparentThat's awesome!! I must've ran into kweb when designing the DSL at first - they're so similar. I'm secretly a huge kotlin fan and love the kotlin DSLs and concurrency models. reply airstrike 50 minutes agoprevI kinda wish instead of RSX we got something closer to SwiftUI than to React/JSX I feel like despite the name and all the good it did for JS and the web, React is not exactly how I would envision \"reactive UI\" code to look like in 2024 if we have the choice of designing a language (or DSL) from a blank state Which is not to say SwiftUI is perfect, but whatever code I write with it feels much more neatly organized / compartmentalized than similar code using React IMHO the only real advantage of using JSX for cross-platform GUIs is... to reuse existing libraries that were built for the web, which means something like RSX has very little \"transferable value\" other than letting the developer transfer their conceptual knowledge of JSX to RSX. I'd argue that's a worse tradeoff than having the developer learn some new paradigm that is (again IMHO) objectively superior to the React/JSX one TL;DR \"SwiftUI but cross-platform\" is the project I wish existed but doesn't. I'm aware of @Tokamak/TokamakUI but that's still very much incomplete and activity seems to have waned reply prabir 7 minutes agoparentThere is https://ribir.org/. Currently it only supports native desktop apps on Linux/mac/windows but they have plans for WASM/web/mobile. reply airstrike 2 minutes agorootparentThanks for sharing that. It looks very interesting and I had not come across it even after lots of googling. It's still in 0.2 but I will definitely keep track of its development, so thank you reply skybrian 5 hours agoprevI’m not a Rust programmer, but I’m curious, and I’m wondering if someone could explain how their generational-box crate works? [1] I understand that it’s some kind of arena allocation, but I don’t understand how they support copying without copying, or how this is safe: > Internally, generational-box creates an arena of generational RefCell's that are recycled when the owner is dropped. You can think of the cells as something like &'static RefCell> with a generational check to make recycling a cell easier to debug. Then GenerationalBox's are Copy because the &'static pointer is Copy Like okay, you can create a pointer to static data, but what if it’s something that doesn’t have a static lifetime? [1] https://crates.io/crates/generational-box reply Evan-Almloff 4 hours agoparentWe are copying the reference to the data, not the data itself. The reference to the data lasts for the lifetime of the program. Generational box lets you insert data that last for shorter than the lifetime of the program (as long as that data contains no references). Once you drop the data you inserted, we reuse the box for other allocations. It uses a very similar approach to a generational arena but with boxes instead of a centralized arena (to avoid locking issues). If you try to access the Copy reference to the data after it has been dropped, it will fail with a nice error message reply skybrian 4 hours agorootparentThanks. I’m wondering if this allows for non-static data at all? Maybe it has to be either static or copyable? reply Evan-Almloff 3 hours agorootparentAll data you insert into a generational box needs to be allowed to last for the 'static lifetime (have no internal temporary pointers). You cannot insert something like &'a str into a generational box reply steveklabnik 5 hours agoparentprevI am not familiar with this crate, but I am with Rust, here’s my take: Copy is a specific thing in Rust, it means that if a type implements the Copy trait, it can be copied via a memcpy, that is, it’s like a “shallow” copy as opposed to a “deep” copy. So they’re not “copying without copying”, they’re letting you treat a non-Copy type as a Copy type, in my understanding. > what if it’s something that doesn’t have a static lifetime? The read me says it requires static content so the answer is “you can’t do that.” reply skybrian 2 hours agorootparentCould you use position-independent internal references (relative pointers) to make data copyable? Does Rust have good support for that? reply steveklabnik 42 minutes agorootparentRust does not have native support for relative pointers, so you'd have to hack that together with unsafe. It's not generally done. reply m0meni 5 hours agoprevBeen following this for a while and super excited to see it out! I love how Dioxus captures a lot of what made React successful, but also while innovating on top of it and shipping at a super fast rate. Congrats to the team. Excited to try out the signals in this release. reply KolmogorovComp 5 hours agoprevI've been following dioxus with interest despite not having a chance to use it yet. However I'm a bit perplexed with the solution to remove lifetimes [0]. Isn't it a poor's-man GC? What was the performance impact? [0]: https://crates.io/crates/generational-box Side-note: `[generational-box](https://crates.io/crates/generational-box)` link is broken reply jkelleyrtp 5 hours agoparentIt is poor man's GC, but the memory semantics are exactly the same as the previous version. Since `use_hook` owns a value for the lifetime of the component, that value is dropped when the component drops. All signals still `use_hook` so their lifetimes are the same. No performance impact whatsoever since we generally discourage calling `GenerationalBox::new()` outside of use_hook. Now if you spammed `GenerationalBox::new()` in a loop or something, yeah, your garbage will exist until the component drops. But most of the time folks will just push/pop from a Map or a Vec and regular memory semantics apply. reply ramesh31 5 hours agoparentprev>However I'm a bit perplexed with the solution to remove lifetimes [0]. Isn't it a poor's-man GC?

Last time I checked the focus was on web targets and both the built in wgpu renderer and skia backend were not supported as much. reply airstrike 59 minutes agoparentYeah, that was my impression too which is why I passed on it and went with Tauri instead. Which is not to say that Tauri perfectly map to the boxes I wanted checked, but beggars can't be choosers reply swsieber 5 hours agoprev> There’s still a tiny bit of unsafe floating around various dependencies that we plan to remove throughout the 0.5 release cycle I'd love to see what these usages are, and what motivates this. I understand that sometimes people reach for unsafe too eagerly. But the std is full of unsafe and drawing the line there sometimes seems like a line in the sand. reply jkelleyrtp 4 hours agoparentIt's mostly just needed to interact with FFI and declare some types as Send/Sync. We use it in 3 places: - fixing some FFI on iOS - enabling function-call syntax for signals (took this implementation from dtolnay) - implementing Send/Sync for an ID that uses a pointer as a hash (which honestly could be removed in lieu of a usize, now that I'm looking at it) reply swsieber 3 hours agorootparentOh, OK. That sounds more like stuff you're directly responsible for, and it looks sensible. reply n42 4 hours agoparentprevI agree, people can be a little too afraid of unsafe. but I don't think it's necessarily ill-advised for a crate author to make a goal of removing unsafe from their crate. crate authors that try to remove all unsafe often do it to relieve the burden of trust from the user. _this_, in my opinion, is the power of the `unsafe` keyword (which probably should have been split into `trust_me` blocks and `check_yourself` functions). it constrains the conversations about memory safety into very tightly defined and auditable locations in the code, AND it creates new, manageable conversations about trust. reply ashia 2 hours agoprevCongrats on the launch! Really excited to see the move to signals + curious to see how Blitz 2.0 goes. reply dasloop 5 hours agoprev\"Here at Dioxus Labs, we have an unofficial rule: only one rewrite per year.\" If you have to rewrite your code once a year, maybe it helps to plan ahead before coding. But, if you can rewrite your code once a year, you might not have too much code to worry about. reply jkelleyrtp 5 hours agoparentAgreed, but we've been doing a lot of R&D discovering new ways of doing things. Dioxus was the first Rust framework to do template-based hotreloading and we couldn't have predicted that was even possible 2 years ago. The Copy-state stuff also seemed impossible a year ago, so no way to plan ahead. Now, I think things have matured enough that there's hopefully not a major major rewrite for a long time. reply 63stack 5 hours agorootparentDid something happen in rust that made the copy state thing work? Or was it just \"huh nobody thought of this before\"? reply jkelleyrtp 4 hours agorootparentSomeone else figured it out :-) I think we had a prototype of it a long time ago but couldn't figure out how to implement drop. Leptos came out but just leaked the runtime in its initial rev. We figured we could safely recycle the runtimes and voila, problem solved. reply palmfacehn 5 hours agoprevHow does this render native apps? Is it still within a browser instance of some kind? reply jkelleyrtp 5 hours agoparentYou can choose between using the system's webview as your renderer or an experimental WGPU-based engine that pulls in stylo (the piece of servo shared with Firefox). We're hoping to move folks to the WGPU renderer in the long term, but it's still pretty raw and many companies using Dioxus are pragmatic enough to know that a webview is a good enough solution for like 90% of apps. reply littlestymaar 5 hours agorootparentI had a mixed feeling about your idea of writing your own HTML renderer (because making it so it is actually compatible with how browser engine are rendering their stuff is actually very hard, and even browser vendors don't actually agree on how everything should render) but seeing that you are leveraging work from servo, and even hired a former mozillian in that effort makes me much more confident in your ability to actually deliver. I wish you good luck! reply rtp4me 6 hours agoprevCongrats to the team! I know it has been a long process, but kudos for sticking with it! reply jkelleyrtp 5 hours agoparentIt was 3 months of work and you probably saw our alphas kicking around for a while. We had been thinking about this rewrite for like 6 months, but put it off for a while. Glad we dove into it since the finished product is so much better. reply J_Shelby_J 5 hours agoprevI'm really excited about this project because it means you can build a single app and deploy it easily anywhere. And in a single language. reply orthecreedence 1 hour agoparentAnd a good language. Flutter/Dart promises this, but I really, really hate Dart. reply skybrian 50 minutes agorootparentSwitching from Dart to Rust doesn't seem like a usability improvement, though? It's good for other things like performance and safe concurrency, but a language that has GC seems easier for web development. reply orthecreedence 25 minutes agorootparentI've tackled UI from both the web end and the rust end, and I honestly can't say which I prefer. Javascript is definitely quicker and easier, I'll give you that, but I hold my nose when writing in it and people have been building interfaces in compiled/typed languages for decades without issue. I'd say it really depends on developer preference. I've grown to appreciate working with typed interfaces, and rust's compiler eliminates so many pains of working in the low-level space that I think it hits a really good mix of usability and performance. Do UIs really need the performance that the nerds on here gripe about every time something like Electron comes up? Probably not, so maybe HTML+Javascript (or WASM) is the winning combo. I don't really care either way, as long as I don't have to learn 5 different languages, platforms, UI frameworks, etc to release an app for desktop and phones as a single developer. And I already know Rust, so another option in that regard is welcome. reply mattdmrs 46 minutes agorootparentprevHonestly curious: what makes you hate it so much? reply orthecreedence 31 minutes agorootparentI found it hit a strange position between trying to be friendly and trying to be powerful. Things felt very inconsistent. After learning a few patterns in the language, other things I would expect to follow the same patterns went off in their own direction. I wish I could conjure up more specific examples but that's about all I remember from it. It felt like a language that was built for the singular purpose of supporting Flutter (which I actually did enjoy learning) instead of something that needed to exist in its own right. I wish they'd just picked something already baked. reply zengid 5 hours agoprevHuge release, congrats! I'm most interested in Dioxus-Blitz.

Tauri puts your frontend in the webview and you need to communicate with native Rust functions through an IPC boundary (like electron). In Dioxus your Rust code lives on the native side, so you don't need IPC to do things like read from the file system, websockets, etc. Tauri also forces your frontend to compile to WASM, and a lot of interesting rust crates don't compile to wasm. It's a little hard to express how much simpler it is to build when you don't have an IPC boundary. Dioxus' tooling is also dedicated to just Rust, so you can go from zero to bundled `.app` in less than a minute (12 seconds fresh build, 20 seconds fresh bundle). That being said we're huge fans of Tauri and the flexibility it gives you (frontend in whatever web-compatible UI you want) and you can even use Dioxus in your Tauri apps! reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 5 hours agorootparentI see what you mean, but to a reader unfamiliar with tauri this makes it sound really bad. Here's how I use tauri: Almost everything is native rust in the \"backend\" process, which is where main is. I don't need any ffi calls to write files, open ports, etc, it's a normal rust program that happens to have a web view. So I've never had a problem with compiling to wasm, the GUI is TypeScript and the business logic is aot rust The ipc boundary is annoying. It'll be faster in tauri 2, but in 1 it uses json or something internally, so you couldn't e.g. write a video player that uses a custom rust codec. Getting uncompressed video frames through ipc would kill perf I'll take a look how dioxus solves this reply jkelleyrtp 5 hours agorootparentOne of this release's features is getting byte streams into the webview using custom protocols. It's not as ideal as say, sharing a GPU texture with the webview, but powerful enough to do video streaming and data viz. reply dceddia 2 hours agorootparentprev> Tauri also forces your frontend to compile to WASM I’ve been using Tauri (1.x) for a couple years shipping a video editor and I don’t think this is true? I went searching to verify and I couldn’t find anything saying it complies to WASM (or at least not that it requires compiling to WASM). Can you point me to where you saw this? reply jkelleyrtp 2 hours agorootparentIf you want to use a Rust frontend framework with Tauri you need to compile to wasm. You typically use svelte/vue/react etc as the frontend, or I guess you could attempt some sort of MPA approach with SSR. Here's a guide for using Yew with Tauri. Notice how you need to install wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack. https://dev.to/stevepryde/create-a-desktop-app-in-rust-using... reply dceddia 1 hour agorootparentOhh sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying there. I'm just using Svelte in TypeScript and running it in the browser so it doesn't need to do the WASM step. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 2 hours agorootparentprevWhoa. Video editor is exactly what I assumed Tauri couldn't reasonably do. (See sibling comment - I also haven't used wasm since my UI is all TS) How'd you get that working? reply dceddia 1 hour agorootparentI initially ran into that issue too (sending frames over IPC was not gonna work!) so I create a native OS-specific overlay and draw on it with wgpu. The IPC layer has been a bit annoying and I'm looking forward to Tauri 2 where that'll get faster. I've worked around it for some stuff in the meantime by using a custom protocol and serializing stuff to binary. reply hotfixguru 4 hours agoprevYesterday there was another really interesting rust library, egui, on the front page of HN.

    "originBody": "Researchers demonstrate a technique that can be used to probe a model to see what it knows about new subjects. Adam ZeweMIT News Publication Date: March 25, 2024 Press Inquiries Caption: Researchers from MIT and elsewhere found that complex large language machine-learning models use a simple mechanism to retrieve stored knowledge when they respond to a user prompt. The researchers can leverage these simple mechanisms to see what the model knows about different subjects, and also possibly correct false information that it has stored. Credits: Image: iStock Large language models, such as those that power popular artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT, are incredibly complex. Even though these models are being used as tools in many areas, such as customer support, code generation, and language translation, scientists still don’t fully grasp how they work. In an effort to better understand what is going on under the hood, researchers at MIT and elsewhere studied the mechanisms at work when these enormous machine-learning models retrieve stored knowledge. They found a surprising result: Large language models (LLMs) often use a very simple linear function to recover and decode stored facts. Moreover, the model uses the same decoding function for similar types of facts. Linear functions, equations with only two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward, straight-line relationship between two variables. The researchers showed that, by identifying linear functions for different facts, they can probe the model to see what it knows about new subjects, and where within the model that knowledge is stored. Using a technique they developed to estimate these simple functions, the researchers found that even when a model answers a prompt incorrectly, it has often stored the correct information. In the future, scientists could use such an approach to find and correct falsehoods inside the model, which could reduce a model’s tendency to sometimes give incorrect or nonsensical answers. “Even though these models are really complicated, nonlinear functions that are trained on lots of data and are very hard to understand, there are sometimes really simple mechanisms working inside them. This is one instance of that,” says Evan Hernandez, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student and co-lead author of a paper detailing these findings. Hernandez wrote the paper with co-lead author Arnab Sharma, a computer science graduate student at Northeastern University; his advisor, Jacob Andreas, an associate professor in EECS and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); senior author David Bau, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern; and others at MIT, Harvard University, and the Israeli Institute of Technology. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations. Finding facts Most large language models, also called transformer models, are neural networks. Loosely based on the human brain, neural networks contain billions of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that are grouped into many layers, and which encode and process data. Much of the knowledge stored in a transformer can be represented as relations that connect subjects and objects. For instance, “Miles Davis plays the trumpet” is a relation that connects the subject, Miles Davis, to the object, trumpet. As a transformer gains more knowledge, it stores additional facts about a certain subject across multiple layers. If a user asks about that subject, the model must decode the most relevant fact to respond to the query. If someone prompts a transformer by saying “Miles Davis plays the. . .” the model should respond with “trumpet” and not “Illinois” (the state where Miles Davis was born). “Somewhere in the network’s computation, there has to be a mechanism that goes and looks for the fact that Miles Davis plays the trumpet, and then pulls that information out and helps generate the next word. We wanted to understand what that mechanism was,” Hernandez says. The researchers set up a series of experiments to probe LLMs, and found that, even though they are extremely complex, the models decode relational information using a simple linear function. Each function is specific to the type of fact being retrieved. For example, the transformer would use one decoding function any time it wants to output the instrument a person plays and a different function each time it wants to output the state where a person was born. The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions, and then computed functions for 47 different relations, such as “capital city of a country” and “lead singer of a band.” While there could be an infinite number of possible relations, the researchers chose to study this specific subset because they are representative of the kinds of facts that can be written in this way. They tested each function by changing the subject to see if it could recover the correct object information. For instance, the function for “capital city of a country” should retrieve Oslo if the subject is Norway and London if the subject is England. Functions retrieved the correct information more than 60 percent of the time, showing that some information in a transformer is encoded and retrieved in this way. “But not everything is linearly encoded. For some facts, even though the model knows them and will predict text that is consistent with these facts, we can’t find linear functions for them. This suggests that the model is doing something more intricate to store that information,” he says. Visualizing a model’s knowledge They also used the functions to determine what a model believes is true about different subjects. In one experiment, they started with the prompt “Bill Bradley was a” and used the decoding functions for “plays sports” and “attended university” to see if the model knows that Sen. Bradley was a basketball player who attended Princeton. “We can show that, even though the model may choose to focus on different information when it produces text, it does encode all that information,” Hernandez says. They used this probing technique to produce what they call an “attribute lens,” a grid that visualizes where specific information about a particular relation is stored within the transformer’s many layers. Attribute lenses can be generated automatically, providing a streamlined method to help researchers understand more about a model. This visualization tool could enable scientists and engineers to correct stored knowledge and help prevent an AI chatbot from giving false information. In the future, Hernandez and his collaborators want to better understand what happens in cases where facts are not stored linearly. They would also like to run experiments with larger models, as well as study the precision of linear decoding functions. “This is an exciting work that reveals a missing piece in our understanding of how large language models recall factual knowledge during inference. Previous work showed that LLMs build information-rich representations of given subjects, from which specific attributes are being extracted during inference. This work shows that the complex nonlinear computation of LLMs for attribute extraction can be well-approximated with a simple linear function,” says Mor Geva Pipek, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Tel Aviv University, who was not involved with this work. This research was supported, in part, by Open Philanthropy, the Israeli Science Foundation, and an Azrieli Foundation Early Career Faculty Fellowship.

My intuition is that the structure inherent to language makes Word2Vec possible. Then training on terabytes of human text encoded with Word2Vec + Positional Encoding makes it possible to then have the ability to predict the next encoding at superhuman levels of cognition (while training!). It's my sense that the bag of words input/output combined with limited context windows (to make Positional Encoding work) is a huge impedance mismatch. Thus I think that given the orders of magnitude more compute thrown at GPT-4 et al, it's entirely possible new forms of representation evolved and remain to be discovered by humans probing through all the weights. I also think that MemGPT could, eventually, become an AGI because of the unlimited long term memory. More likely, though, I think it would be like the protagonist in Memento[1].

Is it really that suprising that we just see this same structure repeated in the models. Just because feedforward topologies with single neuron steps are the easiest to train and run on graphics cards does that really make them the actual best at accomplishing tasks? We have all sorts of unique training methods and encoding schemes that don't ever get used because the big libraries don't support them. Until, we start seeing real varation in the fundamental rulesets of neuralnets we are always just going to be fighting against the fact these are just perceptrons with extra steps. reply visarga 3 hours agoparent> Just because feedforward topologies with single neuron steps are the easiest to train and run on graphics cards does that really make them the actual best at accomplishing tasks? You are ignoring a mountain of papers trying all conceivable approaches to create models. It is evolution by selection, in the end transformers won. reply foobiekr 1 hour agorootparent\"won\" They barely work for a lot of cases (i.e., anything where accuracy matters, despite the bubble's wishful thinking). It's likely that something will sunset them in the next few years. reply victorbjorklund 1 hour agorootparentThat is how evolution works. Something wins until something else comes along and win. And so on forever. reply nicklecompte 2 hours agorootparentprevHis point is that \"evolution by selection\" also includes that transformers are easy to implement with modern linear algebra libraries and cheap to scale on current silicon, both of which are engineering details with no direct relationship to their innate efficacy at learning (though indirectly it means you scale up the training data for more inefficient learning). reply wanderingbort 1 hour agorootparentI think it is correct to include practical implementation costs in the selection. Theoretical efficacy doesn’t guarantee real world efficacy. I accept that this is self reinforcing but I favor real gains today over potentially larger gains in a potentially achievable future. I also think we are learning practical lessons on the periphery of any application of AI that will apply if a mold-breaking solution becomes compelling. reply retrofrost 2 hours agorootparentprevJust because papers are getting published doesn't mean its actually gaining any traction. I mean we have known that time series of signals recieves plays a huge role in how bio neurons functionally operate and yet we have nearly no examples of spiking networks being pushed beyond basic academic exploration. We have known glial cells play a critical role in biological neural and yet you can probably count the number of papers that examine using an abstraction of that activity in neural net, on both your hands and toes. Neuroevolution using genetic algorithms has been basically looking for a big break since NEAT.

Can you help my little brain understand the problem by elaborating? Also you may want to chill with the personal attacks. reply erisinger 1 hour agorootparentNot a personal attack. These posters are smarter than I am, just ribbing them about misusing the terminology. \"Maxima\" is plural, \"maximum\" is singular.

Math is a few operations applied to carving up stuff and we believe we can do that infinitely in theory. So “all math that abides our axiomatic underpinnings” is valid regardless if we “prove it” or not. Physical space we can exist in, a middle ground of reality we evolved just so to exist in, seems to be finite; I can’t just up and move to Titan or Mars. So our computers are coupled to the same constraints of observation and understanding as us. What about daily life will be upended reconfirming decades old experiment?

They're built on the corpses of millions of models that never went anywhere. I spent an entire year trying to scale up a stupid RNN back in 2014. Never went anywhere, because it didn't work. I am sure we are stuck in a local minima now - but it's able to solve problems that were previously impossible. So we will use it until we are impossibly stuck again. Currently, however, we have barely begun to scratch the surface of what's possible with these models. reply dartos 3 hours agorootparentprevI mean RWKV seems promising and isn’t a transformer model.

If so: how do you embed a KV-store into an edge-propagated graphical model? Are there even any well-known techniques for doing that “by hand” right now? (Also, fun tangent: isn't the \"memory palace\" memory technique, an example of human brains embedding facts into a linear function for easier retrieval?) reply jacobn 5 hours agoparentThe fundamental operation done by the transformer, softmax(Q.K^T).V, is essentially a KV-store lookup. The Query is dotted with the Key, then you take the softmax to pick mostly one winning Key (the Key closest to the Query basically), and then use the corresponding Value. That is really, really close to a KV lookup, except it's a little soft (i.e. can hit multiple Keys), and it can be optimized using gradient descent style methods to find the suitable QKV mappings. reply naveen99 4 hours agorootparentNot sure there is any real lookup happening. Q,K are the same and sometimes even v is the same… reply toxik 2 hours agorootparentQ, K, V are not the same. In self-attention, they are all computed by separate linear transformation of the same input (ie the previous layer’s output). In cross-attention even this is not true, then K and V are computed by linear transformation of whatever is cross-attended, and Q is computed by linear transformation of the input as before. reply ewild 2 hours agorootparentyeah a common misconception people think because the input is the same they forget that their is a pre attention linear transofrmation for q k and v (using the decoder only version obv v is diff with encoder decoder bert style) reply bionhoward 5 hours agoparentprev[Layer] Normalization constrains huge vectors representing tokens (input fragments) to positions on a unit ball (I think), and the attention mechanism operates by rotating the unconstrained ones based on the sum of their angles relative to all the others. I only skimmed the paper but believe the point here is that there are relatively simple functions hiding in or recoverable from the bigger network which specifically address certain categories of relationships between concepts. Since it would, in theory, be possible to optimize such functions more directly if they are possible to isolate, could this enable advances in the way such models are trained? Absolutely. After all, one of the best criticisms of “modern” AI is the notion we’re just mixing around a soup of linear algebra. Allowing some sense of modularity (reductionism) could make them less of a black box and more of a component driven approach (in the lagging concept space and not just the leading layer space) reply thfuran 5 hours agoparentprev>isn't the \"memory palace\" memory technique, an example of human brains embedding facts into a linear function for easier retrieval? I'm not sure I see how that's a linear function. reply mike_hearn 5 hours agoprevThis is really cool. My mind goes immediately to what sort of functions are being used to encode programming knowledge, and if they are also simple linear functions whether the standard library or other libraries can be directly uploaded into an LLMs brain as it evolves, without needing to go through a costly training or performance-destroying fine-tune. That's still a sci-fi ability today but it seems to be getting closer. reply Animats 4 hours agoparentThat's a good point. It may be possible to directly upload predicate-type info into a LLM. This could be especially useful if you need to encode tabular data. Somewhere, someone probably read this and is thinking about how to export Excel or databases to an LLM. It's encouraging to see people looking inside the black box successfully. The other big result in this area was that paper which found a representation of a game board inside a LLM after the LLM had trained to play a game. Any other good results in that area? The authors point out that LLMs are doing more than encoding predicate-type info. That's just part of what they are doing. reply wongarsu 3 hours agorootparentThe opposite is also exciting: build a loss function that punishes models for storing knowledge. One of the issues of current models is that they seem to favor lookup over reasoning. If we can punish models (during training) for remembering that might cause them to become better at inference and logic instead. reply kossTKR 52 minutes agorootparentInteresting. Reminds me of a sci-fi short i read years ago where AI's \"went insane\" when they had too much knowledge because they'd spent too much time looking through data and get a buffer overflow. I know some of the smaller models like PHI-2 are training for reasoning specifically before by training on question answer sets, though this seems like the opposite to me. reply AaronFriel 4 hours agorootparentprevIt indeed is. An attention mechanism's key and value matrices grow linearly with context length. With PagedAttention[1], we could imagine an external service providing context. The hard part is the how, of course. We can't load our entire database in every conversation, and I suspect there are also challenges around training (perhaps addressed via LandmarkAttention[2]) and building a service efficiently retrieve additional key-value matrices. The external service vector database may require tight timings necessary to avoid stalling LLMs. To manage 20-50 tokens/sec, answers must arrive within 50-20ms. And we cannot do this in real-time, pausing the transformer when a layer produces a query vector stalls the batch, so we need a way to predict queries (or embeddings) several tokens ahead of where they'd be useful and inject the context in when it's needed, and to know when to page it out.

Maybe Neo was an LLM. \"I know kung-fu.\" reply seydor 19 minutes agoprevDoes this point to a way to compress entire LLMs by selecting a set of relations? reply estebarb 5 hours agoprevI find this similar to what relation vectors do in word2vec: you can add a vector of \"X of\" and often get the correct answer. It could be that the principle is still the same, and transformers \"just\" build a better mapping of entities into the embedding space? reply PaulHoule 4 hours agoparentI think so. It’s hard for me to believe that the decision surfaces inside those models are really curved enough (like the folds of your brain) to really take advantage of FP32 numbers inside vectors: that is I just don’t believe it is x = 0 means “fly” x = 0.01 means “drive” x = 0.02 means “purple” but rather more like x1.5 means “hot” which is one reason why quantization (often 1 bit) works. Also it is a reason why you can often get great results feeding text or images through a BERT or CLIP-type model and then applying classical ML models that frequently involve linear decision surfaces. reply taneq 4 hours agorootparentAre you conflating nonlinear embedding spaces with the physical curvature of the cerebellum? I don't think there's a direct mapping. reply PaulHoule 3 hours agorootparentMy mental picture is that violently curved decision surfaces could look like the convolutions of the brain even though they have nothing to do with how the brain actually works. I think of how tSNE and other algorithms sometimes produce projections that sometimes look like that (maybe that’s just what you get when you have to bend something complicated to fit into a 2-d space) and frequently show cusps that to me look like a sign of trouble (took me a while in my PhD work to realize how Poincaré sections from 4 or 6 dimensions can look messed up when a part of the energy surface tilts perpendicularly to the projection surface.) I still find it hard to believe that dense vectors are the right way to deal with text despite the fact that they work so well. For images it is one thing because changing one pixel a little doesn’t change the meaning of an image, but changing a single character of a text can completely change the meaning of the text. Also there’s the reality that if you randomly stick together tokens you get something meaningless, so it seems almost all of the representation space covers ill formed texts and only a low dimensional manifold holds the well formed texts. Now the decision surfaces really have to be nonlinear and crumpled over all but I think there’s a definitely a limit on how crumpled those surfaces can be. reply Y_Y 3 hours agorootparentThis is interesting. It makes me think of an \"immersion\"[0], as in a generalization of the concept of \"embedding\" in differential geometry.

With the lost part being hallucinated in at inference time. reply Kuinox 4 hours agorootparentIf you've read the article, the LLM hallucinations aren't due to the model not knowing the information but a function that choose to remember the wrong thing. reply sinemetu11 2 hours agorootparentFrom the paper: > Finally, we use our dataset and LRE-estimating method to build a visualization tool we call an attribute lens. Instead of showing the next token distribution like Logit Lens (nostalgebraist, 2020) the attribute lens shows the object-token distribution at each layer for a given relation. This lets us visualize where and when the LM finishes retrieving knowledge about a specific relation, and can reveal the presence of knowledge about attributes even when that knowledge does not reach the output. They're just looking at what lights up in the embedding when they feed something in, and whatever lights up is \"knowing\" about that topic. The function is an approximation they added on top of the model. It's important to not conflate this with the actual weights of the model.

Those have been around for decades, but we have only managed to make them coherent for very short outputs. Even GPT2 beats any Markov chain, so there has to be more going on Modern LLMs are able to transfer knowledge between different languages, so it's fair to assume that some mapping between human language and a more abstract internal representation happens at the input and output, instead of the model \"operating\" on English or Chinese or whatever language you talk with it. And once this exists, an internal \"world model\" (as in: a collection of facts and implications) isn't far, and seems to indeed be something most LLMs do. The reasoning on top of that world model is still very spotty though reply numeri 5 hours agorootparentprevYour suggested scheme (assuming a mapping from 10 tokens to 10 tokens, with each token taking 2 bytes to store) would take (32000 * 20) * 2 bytes = 2.3e78 TiB of storage, or about 250 MiB per atom in the observable universe (1e82), prior to compression. I think it's more likely that LLMs are actually learning and understanding concepts as well as memorizing useful facts, than that LLMs have discovered a compression method with that high of a compression ratio, haha. reply mjburgess 4 hours agorootparentLLMs cannot determine the physical location of any atoms. they cannot plan movement, and so on. LLMs are just completing patterns of text that have been given before, 'everthing ever written' is both a lot for any individual person to read; but also, almost nothing, in that to propertly describe a table requires more information text is itself an extremely compressed medium which lacks almost any information about the world; it succeeds in being useful to generate because we have that information and are able to map it back to it reply numeri 4 hours agorootparentI didn't imply that they know anything about where atoms are, I was just pointing out the sheer absurdity of that volume of data. I should make it clear that my comparison there is unfair and mostly just funny – you don't need to store every possible combination of 10 tokens, because most of them will be nonsense, so you wouldn't actually need that much storage. That being said, it's been fairly solidly proven that LLMs aren't just lookup tables/stochastic parrots. reply mjburgess 3 hours agorootparent> fairly solidly proven that LLMs aren't just lookup tables/stochastic parrots Well i'd strongly disagree. I see no evidence of this; I'm am quite well acquainted with the literature. All empirical statistical AI is just a means of approximating an empirical distribution. The problem with NLP is that there is no empirical function from text tokens to meanings; just as there is no function from sets of 2D images to a 3D structure. We know before we start that the distributions of text tokens are only coincidentally related to the distributions of meanings. The question is just how much value that coincidence has in any given task. (Consider, eg., that if I ask, \"do you like what i'm wearing?\" there is no distribution of responses which is correct. I do not want you to say \"yes\" 99/100, or even 100/100 times. etc. what I want you to say is a word caused a mental state you have: that of (dis)liking what i'm wearing. Since no statistical AI systems generate outputs based on causal features of reality, we know a priori that almost all possible questions that can be asked cannot be answered by LLMs. They are only useful where questions have cannonical answers; and only because \"cannonical\" means that a text->text function is likely to be conidentally indistinguishable from a the meaning->meaning function we're interested in). reply pk-protect-ai 4 hours agorootparentprevThere is something wrong with these arithmetic: \"(32000 * 20) * 2 bytes = 2.3e78 TiB of storage\" ... The factorial is missing somewhere in there ... reply HarHarVeryFunny 2 hours agorootparentprev> the 60-70B parameters of models is basically like... just stored patterns of \"if these 10 tokens in a row input, then these 10 tokens in a row output score the highest\" > Is that a good summary? No - there's a lot more going on. It's not just mapping input patterns to output patterns. A good starting point to understand it are linguist's sentence-structure trees (and these were the inspiration for the \"transformer\" design of these LLMs). https://www.nltk.org/book/ch08.html Note how there are multiple levels of nodes/branches to these trees, from the top node representing the sentence as a whole, to the words themselves which are all the way at the bottom. An LLM like ChatGPT is made out of multiple layers (e.g. 96 layers for GPT-3) of transformer blocks, stacked on top of each other. When you feed an input sentence into an LLM, the sentence will first be turned into a sequence of token embeddings, then passed through each of these 96 layers in turn, each of which changes (\"transforms\") it a little bit, until it comes out the top of the stack as the predicted output sentence (or something that can be decoded into the output sentence). We only use the last word of the output sentence which is the \"next word\" it has predicted. You can think of these 96 transformer layers as a bit like the levels in one of those linguistic sentence-structure trees. At the bottom level/layer are the words themselves, and at each successive higher level/layer are higher-and-higher level representations of the sentence structure. In order to understand this a little better, you need to understand what these token \"embeddings\" are, which is the form in which the sentence is passed through, and transformed by, these stacked transformer layers. To keep it simple, think of a token as a word, and say the model has a vocabulary of 32,000 words. You might perhaps expect that each word is represented by a number in the range 1-32000, but that is not the way it works! Instead, each word is mapped (aka \"embedded\") to a point in a high dimensional space (e.g. 4096-D for LLaMA 7B), meaning that it is represented by a vector of 4096 numbers (cf a point in 3-D space represented as (x,y,z)). These 4096 element \"embeddings\" are what actually pass thru the LLM and get transformed by it. Having so many dimensions gives the LLM a huge space in which it can represent a very rich variety of concepts, not just words. At the first layer of the transformer stack these embeddings do just represent words, the same as the nodes do at the bottom layer of the sentence-structure tree, but more information is gradually added to the embeddings by each layer, augmenting and transforming what they mean. For example, maybe the first transformer layer adds \"part of speech\" information so that each embedded word is now also tagged as a noun or verb, etc. At the next layer up, the words comprising a noun phase or verb phrase may get additionally tagged as such, and so-on as each transformer layer adds more information. This just gives a flavor of what is happening, but basically by the time the sentence has reached the top layer of the transformer it has been able to see the entire tree structure of the sentence, and only then have \"understand\" it well enough to predict a grammatically and semantically \"correct\" continuation from which it is able to predict continuation words. reply Acumen321 4 hours agoparentprevQuantization in this context is the precision of each value in the vector or matrix/tensor. If the model in question has a token embedding length of 1024, even if it was a 1 bit quantization, each token has 2^1024 possible values. If the context length is 32,000 tokens, there are 32,000^2^1024 possible inputs. reply i5heu 4 hours agoprevSo it is entirely possible to decouple the reasoning part from the information part? This is like absolutely mind blowing if this is true. reply learned 3 hours agoparentA big caveat mentioned in the article is that this experiment was done with a small set (N=47) of specific questions that they expected to have relatively simple relational answers: > The researchers developed a method to estimate these simple functions, and then computed functions for 47 different relations, such as “capital city of a country” and “lead singer of a band.” While there could be an infinite number of possible relations, the researchers chose to study this specific subset because they are representative of the kinds of facts that can be written in this way. About 60% of these relations were retrieved using a linear function in the model. The remaining appeared to have nonlinear retrieval and is still a subject of investigation: > Functions retrieved the correct information more than 60 percent of the time, showing that some information in a transformer is encoded and retrieved in this way. “But not everything is linearly encoded. For some facts, even though the model knows them and will predict text that is consistent with these facts, we can’t find linear functions for them. This suggests that the model is doing something more intricate to store that information,” he says. reply vsnf 5 hours agoprev> Linear functions, equations with only two variables and no exponents, capture the straightforward, straight-line relationship between two variables Is this definition considering the output to be included in the set of variables? What a strange way to phrase it. Under this definition, I wonder what an equation with one variable is. Is a single constant an equation? reply hansvm 4 hours agoparentIt's just a change in perspective. Consider a vertical line. To have an \"output\" variable you have to switch the ordinary `y=mx+b` formulation to `x=c`. The generalization `ax+by=c` accommodates any shifted line you can draw. Adding more variables increases the dimension of the space in consideration (`ax+by+cz=d` could potentially define a plane). Adding more equations potentially reduces the size of the space in consideration (e.g., if `x+y=1` then also knowing `2x+2y=2` wouldn't reduce the solution space, but `x-y=0` would, and would imply `x=y=1/2`, and further adding `x+2y=12` would imply a lack of solutions). Mind you, the \"two variable\" statement in this news piece is a red-herring. The paper describes higher-dimension linear relationships, of the form `Mv=c` for some constant matrix `M`, some constant vector `c`, and some variable vector `v`. On some level, the result isn't _that_ surprising. The paper only examines one layer (not the whole network), after the network has done a huge amount of embedding work. In that layer, they find that under half the time they're able to get over 60% of the way there with a linear approximation. Another interpretation is that the single layer does some linear work and shoves it through some nonlinear transformations, and more than half the time that nonlinearity does something very meaningful (and even in that under half the time where the linear approximation is \"okay\", the metrics are still bad). I'm not super impressed, but I don't have time to full parse the thing right now. It is a bit surprising; if memory serves, one of the authors on this paper had a much better result in terms of neural network fact editing in the last year or two. This looks like a solid research idea, solid work, it didn't pan out, and to get it published they heavily overstated the conclusions (and then the university press release obviously bragged as much as it could). reply ksenzee 5 hours agoparentprevI think they're trying to say \"equations in the form y = mx + b\" without getting too technical. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 5 hours agoparentprevYeah I guess they mean one independent variable and one dependent variable It rarely matters because if you had 2 dependent variables, you can just express that as 2 equations, so you might as well assume there's exactly 1 dependent and then only discuss the number of independent variables. reply pb060 4 hours agoparentprevAren’t functions and equations two different things? reply olejorgenb 5 hours agoparentprevI would think `x = 4` is considered an equation, yes? reply pessimizer 4 hours agorootparentAnd linear at that: x = 0y + 4 reply wslh 5 hours agoprevCan we roughly say that LLMs produces (training mode) a lot of IF-THENs in an automatic way from a vast quantity of information (nor techniques) that was not available before? reply uoaei 1 hour agoprevThis is the \"random linear projections as memorization technique\" perspective on Transformers.

The sanction, of close to $8 million (or in local currency: PLN 31,850,141), also calls out the e-commerce giant for deceptive design elements which may inject a false sense of urgency into the purchasing process and mislead shoppers about elements like product availability and delivery dates. The country’s consumer and competition watchdog, the UOKiK, has been looking into complaints about Amazon’s sales practices since September 2021, following complaints from shoppers, including some who did not receive their purchases. The authority opened a formal investigation into Amazon’s practices in February 2023. Wednesday’s sanction is the conclusion of that probe. The UOKiK found consumers who ordered products on Amazon could have their purchases subsequently cancelled by the tech giant as it does not treat the moment of purchase as the conclusion of a sales contract, despite sending consumers confirmation of their order — even after consumers have paid for the product. For Amazon, the conclusion of a sales contract only occurs once it has sent information about the actual shipment. In a press release detailing the enforcement, it said Amazon failed to clearly communicate this salient detail to shoppers, finding it only provided the information at “the last stage of purchase”. It also found the information was sometimes “difficult” for consumers to access, noting for example Amazon could use a grey font on a white background in text displayed at the very bottom of a page — a classic example of so-called ‘dark pattern design‘. The UOKiK contrasts that deceptive design choice with suggestive messaging Amazon shows to shoppers on sales buttons — which read “Buy now” or “Proceed to finalize the purchase” — which it said imply that by ordering the product the shopper is concluding a contract with Amazon. Which is not, in fact, the case. “Thus, Amazon misleads consumers as to the moment of conclusion of the sales contract,” the authority wrote [in Polish; this is a machine translation]. “For many people, this can also have negative consequences: The consumer does not receive the product, so he cannot use it, he loses the opportunity to buy at an attractive price that may no longer apply, and his money is frozen until he returns it.” Some of the complaints it received also found information about how to cancel an order may be provided long after it was placed, with the UOKiK citing the case of cancellations of e-book reader orders where the critical detail was not provided for a month. A meaningless countdown clock Its enforcement also calls out Amazon for using deceptive design to encourage shoppers to click buy by presenting misleading information about product availability and delivery windows — such as by listing how many items were in stock to be purchased and providing a countdown clock to order an item in order to get it on a particular delivery date. Its investigation found Amazon does not always meet these deadlines for orders, nor ship products immediately as they may be out of stock despite claims to the contrary shown to consumers. “Amazon treats the data it provides on availability and shipping date as indicative but the way it is presented does not indicate this,” the UOKiK noted, adding: “Consumers can only find out about this in the terms of sale on the platform.” Commenting in a statement, the UOKiK’s president, Tomasz Chróstny, said: “Information about product availability and its fast shipping is very valuable for consumers and for many people it may be the main reason why they make a purchase decision. However, such information cannot be a lure. If the entrepreneur provides a specific delivery date, he or she must meet it. This practice by Amazon is classified as so-called dark patterns because it uses pressure to make the consumer order the product as soon as possible.” While Amazon does offer a delivery guarantee — offering a refund if items do not ship within the stated time — the authority found it failed to provide consumers with information about the rules of this service before placing an order. It only offers details at the order summary stage. And then only “if the consumer decides to read the subsequent links specifying delivery details.” Shoppers who did not follow the link to read more may not have been aware of their right to apply for and receive a refund from Amazon if there is a delay in shipment. It also found the e-commerce giant failed to provide information about the “Delivery Guarantee” in the purchase confirmation sent to shoppers. Amazon was contacted for comment on the sanction but at the time of writing it had not responded. It has the option to appeal. Update: Amazon’s press office in Poland has now responded with a statement, confirming it will appeal. The company also writes: Fast and reliable delivery across a wide selection of products is a top priority for us, and Amazon.pl has millions of items available with fast and free Prime delivery. Since launching Amazon.pl in 2021, we have continuously invested and worked hard to provide customers with a clear, reliable delivery promise at check out, and while the vast majority of our deliveries arrive on time, customers can contact us in the rare event that they experience a delay or order cancellation, and we will make it right. Over the last year, we have collaborated with the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK), and proposed multiple voluntary amendments to continue to improve the customer experience on Amazon.pl. We strictly follow legal standards in all countries where we operate and we strongly disagree with the assessment and penalty issued by the UOKiK. We will appeal this decision.

Poland isn’t a big market with Amazon, we have our own local monopoly in this sector called Allegro. edit: ok this is done by UOKiK, a consumer protection agency. This agency has supposedly been doing a stellar job keeping an eye on everything from banking to e-commerce sector. reply StefanBatory 5 hours agoparentPolish Amazon is such in a weird spot. Compared to Allegro, it has close to no offers, and search engine. Just. Doesn't. Work. reply kolinko 5 hours agorootparent+1. When in Poland I use Allegro all the time - way more reliable than Amazon.pl. Not as good as Amazon in the states though. My friends who moved back from the Bay Area still prefer to use Amazon, but they use Amazon.de instead - similar shipping times, and much better selection and reliability. reply chihuahua 4 hours agorootparentNot sure if this is still the case, but Amazon.de used to use fulfillment centers in Poland to deliver to Germany. So if you're in Poland and ordering from Amazon.de, your order could very well be delivered from Poland to Poland. reply gambiting 3 hours agorootparentIn fact there were 3 massive Amazon fullfilment centres in Poland before Amazon.pl even launched lol. It's a weird(but very interesting) market with its own big players that neither Amazon nor ebay managed to compete against. reply voytec 16 minutes agorootparentprevamazon.pl doesn't have English version. Auto-translated titles and descriptions are atrocious. amazon.de on the other hand has English version and stuff is sent from warehouses in Poland anyway. reply ivanjermakov 1 hour agorootparentprevAmazon's search in Poland is atrocious. I only get international offers where shipping costs are higher than good's price. What the hell? reply jakubadamw 5 hours agoparentprevI am honestly baffled Amazon hasn't found a way to compete with Allegro. I am happy about it, but also baffled. Allegro's customer experience is just stellar, whereas Amazon's interface continues to give the impression that it's still a bunch of widgets rendered by a hundred microservices and glued together without any elegant cohesion in mind. It's as if little has changed since the famous Steve Yegge's letter. reply scyzoryk_xyz 3 hours agorootparentI'm no fan of either - Allegro has Amazon executives and nearly identical Prime-free shipping strategy. Pretty sure Allegro has the same effect of monopolizing and driving up prices as Amazon has. I find the eBay-esque artifact interface absurd. It's likely Amazon hasn't found a way because an environment that isn't a monopoly isn't attractive to begin with for that business model. reply slowmotiony 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's even more baffling that Amazon.pl has one of the worst customer support I've ever seen while Amazon.de is a total opposite - an increadibly pleasant experience and packages almost always arrive on the next day. reply dehrmann 5 hours agoparentprev> stellar I'm not sure enough to know if that's sarcastic, but the circumstances make me wonder if this was to promote local competitors or score political points. reply scyzoryk_xyz 4 hours agorootparentNo no, I'm serious. I have friends in banking who had experiences coming under UOKiK scrutiny and they claim that it really has it's shit together. I have no doubt that there is dysfunction in the system, just not when it comes to regulation of this sector apparently. reply Animats 30 minutes agoprevStrange that Amazon would do this. The original selling point of their \"one-click\" system was that it had undo. Everybody else was requiring lots of confirmation, while Amazon was just click and go, with the opportunity to undo mistakes. Amazon has lost that, with their \"No, I don't want to buy Prime\", \"No, I really don't want to buy Prime\", and \"QUIT TRYING TO GET ME TO BUY YOUR PRIME SERVICE\" check out system. reply fy20 8 hours agoprevThe part about the countdown clock for delivery dates is interesting. Amazon is not in my country, but Amazon DE does ship here for not too much. It's often cheaper and sometimes even quicker to order from Amazon DE than a local e-retailer (they often don't have items in stock locally, and need to ship from a warehouse in another country). I wanted to purchase some items, and it gave the usual \"order in the next 8 hours for delivery on Sunday\". I wanted to add some other items later, and forgot about it. I finally got around to placing the order two days later. It gave me a delivery date of... the same Sunday. reply mdrzn 7 hours agoparentI've never had any issues with the countdown clock; it's usually for orders that I want to receive quickly, and it tells me \"if you order within the next 2 hours, it will arrive tomorrow\". So, I doubt that it's a dark pattern (at least in Italy). Then again, if third-party sellers are using this system as a dark pattern, that's a different matter. reply MatekCopatek 7 hours agorootparentJudging by the parent comment, the dark part is the fact that it might be fake pressure. As in - it's true that it will arrive tomorrow if you order within the next 2 hrs, but it will actually arrive tomorrow even if you take 4 hrs. reply aendruk 6 hours agorootparentIsn’t the explanation just that delivery estimates have a wide margin of error? To guarantee delivery by a target date the order must be placed by the beginning of the margin, but if you order within the margin there’s some probability of getting that date by chance. To explain the two estimates days apart both returning the same Sunday, consider that the week is heterogeneous; maybe some regional hop is available specifically on Saturday regardless of how early you order. reply gambiting 3 hours agorootparentSure, but the regulator in this case is making an argument that it's creating an unfair pressure to make you purchase a thing, and that the timer is consistently shorter than it needs to be. It's the same thing as going on a website and it says \"order within next 30 minutes for a 50% discount\" and then you come back an hour later and it still says the same thing - it creates an incentive on you to purchase by creating an illusion of urgency. It's the illusion part that the regulators have a problem with. reply BeetleB 5 hours agorootparentprevThe dark pattern is actually the opposite. People who ordered in the next 2 hours might not get it the next day. If you tell someone \"buy it in the next 2 hours to receive it tomorrow\", you better make sure they get it tomorrow. reply tzs 4 hours agorootparentI don't see how that is necessarily a dark pattern. It would be a dark pattern if they were saying that when they knew it would not make it in time. But if most of the time they do make the deadline, and the times that they do not are caused by problems that arose unexpectedly after the order was places, it is not a dark pattern. reply BeetleB 3 hours agorootparent> and the times that they do not are caused by problems that arose unexpectedly after the order was places, it is not a dark pattern I think the contention here is that they intentionally overcommitted. One would have to see the statistics on how often they miss the promised timeline. reply mdrzn 6 hours agorootparentprevI mean usually the cut-off time is to \"order by 8 PM to get the product delivered the next day\". I'm not convinced that setting the order deadline at 8 PM instead of 10 PM significantly boosts sales. E-commerce platforms are full of dark patterns, but on Amazon (perhaps because I go there when I already know what I want to buy), I haven't noticed many. Another potential dark pattern is that the lowest price is shown for offers with Prime included, while sometimes there are lower prices available for the same product shipped without Prime. However, even in this case, I don't have any complaints. Not defending Amazon obviously, but since I pay for Prime, I definitely want the fastest shipment possible. reply Zigurd 6 hours agorootparentprevI suppose discovery, or even a study of whether the delivery countdown matters to actual delivery, in a case like this is enough to categorize it as a dark pattern. If it can be shown to not matter to actual delivery time, what other purpose does it serve? reply arkey 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you, like me, only go to Amazon when you've already decided to buy a certain thing, then you probably just stay with the \"will arrive tomorrow\" part. However the countdown could add some pressure if you're still deciding on buying something or not, in the form of \"now or never FOMO\". reply throw_a_grenade 5 hours agorootparentprevPolish official release linked in TFA (https://uokik.gov.pl/31-mln-zl-kary-dla-amazon) hints that the problem with that clock was, it wasn't actually a guarantee, because Amazon could have just cancelled the order. That it can just cancel the order based on some technicality (how Amazon defined conclusion of contract) is also illegal in itself. reply duxup 3 hours agoparentprevIt doesn't strike me as particularly unusual for the clock to give one time, and then a different time later. A lot of factors might go into making promises and each time they're evaluated variables may be different. I might give an ETA for some code, say 3 days, then do something else and find an easier way to do the task I was asked about earlier, dude to happenstance or even lower demands on my time ... so that later when asked again I might give an even even earlier ETA. reply Ekaros 4 hours agoparentprevFor Finland it seems they time their shipping by arrival date. So if arrival date is bit away, they only ship a few days later. But it will hit the arrival window. reply akkad33 1 hour agoprevThere's this fitness app called madmuscles https://madmuscles.com/ that takes dark patterns to the extreme.

NYT and many publishers are notorious with their dark patterns to keep you around. The only company that I know of that makes it easier to 'unsubscribe' than to 'subscribe' is netflix. I couldn't believe how easy it was. Didn't have to call them and have them guilt trip me into staying. Or chat with someone or some AI. Just cancel. Though they do email you deals from time to time. But even then only every few weeks or so. reply hnbad 6 hours agoprevIt sounds like Amazon (in Poland at least) has been playing it fast and loose with \"eventual consistency\" but violated the law by basing legally binding claims on the unreliable data. Selling goods that are already out of stock only to then cancel the order later, or indicating a false time pressure to purchase in order to meet a delivery date, etc, all sound like they could as well be genuine mistakes. Amazon just happens to be too big for that to be a valid excuse. reply kubanczyk 5 hours agoparentAccording to the gov investigator a big part of the \"darkness\" in this case were A's terms of service. They moved the moment of entering the legal sale agreement well after the customer could expect from their web interaction. reply jgeada 6 hours agoparentprevExcept they do still charge you first before figuring out they won't actually ship you the goods as promised. It is the charging and then not delivering that is the problem. reply rafram 5 hours agorootparentDo they? In the US, Amazon only actually charges your card once the items ship. Until then it’s just a pre-authorization. reply gambiting 3 hours agorootparentNope, in Poland(and in UK as well) it charges you immediately, unless the item is specifically marked as pre-order(like new unreleased yet games and films - those get charged when they ship, everything else gets charged the moment of order). I've ordered a new router from Amazon few weeks ago, it was showing as \"shipping 5th of April\" (they were on backorder I guess) but they charged my card straight away. reply chihuahua 3 hours agorootparentprevIt seems bizarre to hear about these problems in Poland. Amazon had all this stuff figured out a long time ago. Which is why I order from Amazon all the time - it works reliably, 99.99% of the time.

Whenever I join a Zoom meeting from the Calendar, it first pops open a browser tab, and then that opens the Zoom app. In the year 2024, why can't it open the Zoom app directly? Surely one app can start a process to run another app? reply erikerikson 3 hours agorootparentI suspect it's two factors. The first is that it's not produced by a major and statistically we like an underdog.

(commondreams.org)219 points by robtherobber 9 hours agohidepastfavorite273 comments sudhirj 8 hours agoIntel didn't get a subsidy because they're poor, the subsidy exists because the US Government wants the company to do something (setup a fab on US soil) that is not necessarily in the shareholders best interest (cheaper to set up a fab elsewhere). The subsidy is the difference in both parties judge to be the cost of doing the expensive thing (that matches US strategic interests) vs the cheaper thing. reply op00to 7 hours agoparentPerhaps the government should simply nationalize Intel if they continue to do stock buybacks. There’s more knobs to turn than the free money faucet. reply ChadNauseam 7 hours agorootparentAre you suggesting the government buy Intel, or that they steal it from its current owners? You might have different opinions than I do about the morality of such a thing, but either way it would be disastrous as it would disincentivize all investment in things the US can steal. reply mattalex 7 hours agorootparentThe US could have required stock in Intel instead of taking nothing: Intel gets money, US gets influence over Intel. Just like it works everywhere else. reply bryanlarsen 7 hours agorootparentThere are 3 good ways to give money to the private sector: as a purchase order, in exchange for equity, or as an interest bearing loan. If the company won't accept money in one of those 3 forms they probably don't need it. reply Wytwwww 7 hours agorootparentprev> Just like it works everywhere else. That's certainly not the case, though. reply mdasen 6 hours agorootparentprevWhen giving a company like Intel money, you could give that in exchange for part of the company or for the company to do something for you. For example, the US could give Intel $8B for about 4% of Intel (at today's market price). However, that wouldn't get them the new US chip fab that they want. It would get them 4% ownership of Intel. Another example, the US could give Intel money to build them a supercomputer. The US would get a supercomputer, but it wouldn't get any ownership of Intel. When I buy Intel processors, I get a product, but no ownership of the company. In this case, the US wants to buy a product: a US based fab. You might say \"but the fab benefits Intel.\" You're totally right, but when I buy Intel processors it gives Intel capital they'll use for their benefit as well. The real question is whether the US is overpaying for this fab or if the fab is even worth it. Could the US have gotten the product it wants cheaper? Is having new US based fabs worth paying for? I think the answer to the latter is a resounding \"yes\" for strategic reasons. Tens of billions is a tiny drop in the bucket to help ensure something bad doesn't happen to one of the most important industries to US prosperity. We spend $850B/year on the military to try to ensure continued US security and prosperity. Giving Intel $8B is probably a bargain by comparison. Likewise, if you hate that Intel is being given $8B, you'll really hate how much Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, Northrop, and General Dynamics get from the government. Sure, the US could have required Intel stock as part of the deal, but depending on the amount of stock, Intel would have likely rejected it. Should the US have offered $11-12B for 2% of Intel plus a US fab? If that's the case, why doesn't the US government simply buy stock in Intel today? If your argument is that the US should end up with 20% of Intel for that cash, Intel would reject it. That's giving Intel a tiny fraction of what their stock is worth - 20% of Intel is worth $38B. If the government wanted to nationalize Intel, it'd probably cost them $210-250B. The government isn't just allowed to take something without just compensation. While Intel's market price is $188B, usually buying a whole company involves having to pay a premium over that. The US has taken ownership stakes in companies in some scenarios. For example, the bank \"bailouts\" gave the US preferred stock with a dividend rate of 5% that would climb to 9% from 2008-2013. The government also got warrants to purchase common stock at a very low price. Recipients generally repaid what they were given and the government made billions off the stock warrants. In the case of the bank \"bailouts\", the government was giving the banks money to help save the banks and demanded ownership in return. By contrast, Intel doesn't need help. The US government wants to get Intel to do something; the government wants to pay Intel to make them a product. Maybe the government could have gotten a better deal than $8B. However, given that few companies could legitimately create modern fabs and given that even companies like TSMC have been having difficulty at creating fabs in the US, $8B doesn't seem like a crazy amount of money to be offering as a carrot. It looks like the US is also spending $6B on Samsung and $5B on TSMC to get them to build fabs here. If the US wanted ownership and a new fab, it would cost more than $8B. If the US wanted a new fab plus 10% of Intel, it'd likely cost them $25-30B. reply refurb 5 hours agorootparentprevBuying $8B in equity of a $160B company might get you a board seat (one of 8) but it’s not going to give you control over the company. reply transcriptase 7 hours agorootparentprevThis thread really brought an alarming number of tankies out of the HN woodwork.

One party (US taxpayers) is paying another party (Intel shareholders) to do something specific. What recipients do with the money is their own problem. EDIT: Sorry, read this as strings attached to what Intel could do with the money. I would assume the subsidy is contingent on Intel actually setting up the fab and some output numbers, seems idiotic to do it any other way. Don't think this was a bailout or handout at all. I haven't seen the agreement though. reply buran77 7 hours agorootparentPeople generally see subsidies given to companies as a contract. Subsidies in general aren't a contract. People don't have to \"do their part\" when they benefit from a subsidy (like vote for a specific party because they subsidized the price of gas), and usually neither do companies. reply javagram 7 hours agorootparent> People don't have to \"do their part\" when they benefit from a subsidy (like vote for a specific party because they subsidized the price of gas), and usually neither do companies. This is typically false, usually the subsidies are in the form of tax credits that are only awarded once you perform the desired action, or at least have to be paid back if you fail to do so. They don’t just cut a check and wash their hands. This is true for individuals as well as corporations. When you do your taxes this year, take a look at credits like the renewable energy credit.

This is also why nobody ever wants to cut the DoD budget, it's basically the backbone of American manufacturing for everything.

Cheap labor is a benefit but not the primary reason companies are manufacturing in the U.S. today. Look at TSMC. It started setting up US operations years ago and is expecting to complete many years from now. OTOH they started setting up in Japan about a year or so ago and are already cranking out chips. reply fancyfredbot 8 hours agorootparentThe Japanese plant is less ambitious, using an older process on a smaller scale.

TSMC is looking to bail completely on the second fab / even intel is now looking at delaying.

This is not a good PR move to say this outright so they will just give more generic \"labor\" shortages etc as the official reason. reply api 8 hours agorootparentprevI think you meant “aren’t manufacturing” and you are correct. It’s not cheap labor, except for the lowest end manufacturing. It’s that you can’t build anything in America anymore. The government needs to address that instead of subsidizing one off efforts. reply helsinkiandrew 8 hours agorootparentprev> it's selling out Americans in favor of cheap labor. Perhaps American workers. But an alternate take is that American consumers got cheaper chips and PCs - which resulted in more being sold, more companies and people using them, greater efficiency and new ideas and perhaps a more productive economy. It will be interesting in 5-10 years if the US needs to tax/block possibly cheaper and better components built outside the US being sold reply 34679 7 hours agorootparentIntel, like any other succesful company, prices its goods based on what the market will pay, not what it costs to make. Lower costs does not mean lower prices for customers, it means more profits for Intel. reply helsinkiandrew 6 hours agorootparent> Intel, like any other succesful company, prices its goods based on what the market will pay, not what it costs to make That may be true for Intel's CPUs but when products aren't produced by monopolies, those that have the cheapest costs and are in competition with others, often lower their prices to compete where the competitor can't. For example: AMD, graphics and motherboard parts reply prerok 1 hour agorootparentWell, I take it that it's always true and is a good lesson for anyone trying to set the price for their own product (like a hacked together side project one of us might be working on :) ). My understanding is that the price should never be set based on production cost but on the value it brings to the customer. Thereby, a simple program you or I could hack together in a month, might have a cost of 10k in labor only cost, but if it would save the customer millions each year, they would pay a million for it. So, you set the cost based on how much they are willing to pay, based on how much they would profit/save. If another competitor offers a similar solution, you just undercut them by 10%, or invest another 10k for superior features. reply amarcheschi 6 hours agorootparentprevFurthermore, up until at least a few years ago (i don't know how it is now) intel chips were more expensive than amd's, especially on server side, even accounting on performance/watt and intel adopted practices such as locking mobo to just one chipset and things like that. the situation might be different now tho reply gruez 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah I'm sure that's going to cause investors/other companies to think that the US is a good place to set up shop and/or make further investments. reply belorn 8 hours agorootparentI believe that $77B as a fairly good cause for investors/other companies to set up shop and make investment into the US semiconductors market. According to random market statistic site, it is also currently growing by 10% each year. Is that market so poor that subsidies really is needed on the basis of profitability? reply gruez 6 hours agorootparentA $77B market that's growing by 10% each year doesn't mean much when the government turns against you demands you do a bunch of expensive investments for nationalist reasons. See also: all the investors fleeing china because they were spooked by the tech crackdown/covid lockdowns. \"Punishing a company because it's selling out Americans in favor of cheap labor\" is basically the same thing but with a different coat of paint. reply owisd 8 hours agorootparentprevIntel is a product of Shockley, which was a product of Bell Labs, which was a product of “punishing” AT&T for “being American”. AT&T would have zealously guarded the transistor patent and never have licenced it out to Motorola, TI, etc. if they only cared about maximising shareholder value. reply skywal_l 8 hours agorootparentprevWouldn't be easier for the US government to buy Intel shares rather than subsidies it? It should actually be mandatory for the government to own part of a company that is so critical to national and security interest. reply DonnyV 8 hours agorootparentprevWe're always bending over backwards for a handful of companies instead of promoting a healthy market. We should of created a race with multiple companies to build the best chip factories. reply gruez 8 hours agorootparent> We should of created a race with multiple companies to build the best chip factories. That's insanely expensive. Today the only companies that make leading edge chips are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. Global Foundries (headquartered in US) dropped out a few years ago because it was too expensive. How on earth are you going to fund \"a race with multiple companies to build the best chip factories\"?

Needless to say the intuitions one develops from investing while not being able to create money at will are not entirely applicable. reply taneq 5 hours agorootparentprevI think we're using different definitions. A \"strategic investment for national security\" only has \"net negative value\" is the overall expected outcome is negative. War is pretty expensive so it's worth spending a bit of money to avoid it, or at least sway the outcome. The government doesn't want a dollar ROI in the sense of increased revenues because it defines the dollar. What happens to the local currency is just one factor in the overall considerations. reply pjc50 9 hours agoprev\"Stock buybacks are a form of stock manipulation\" - not really, they're a means of returning money to the shareholders while bypassing taxes on dividends. (Not an expert on the US tax system as I'm a Brit, but it seems that the tax treatment of dividends depends on how long the stock is held, and can be taxed at income tax rates, while stock buybacks result in inflating the stock value which is always CGT. Not sure what the tax treatment is for institutional investors?)

It's infinite zero-dividend growth that's weird (Amazon). reply concinds 9 hours agoparentThey're a means of \"returning money\", but they also pump up the stock price, to which managers' TCs are linked. Hence they are a form of manipulation. Unlike dividends, they don't return money to all shareholders, but to those who sell shares, which are the wealthiest, unnecessarily increasing inequality. Excessive buybacks and underinvestment are a big reason why Intel failed. Gelsinger (CEO) talked about this publicly. It's not just \"returning money to shareholders\", because it leads to perverse incentives and underinvestment.

Not just typical organizational behavior. reply diogofranco 6 hours agorootparentprevBuybacks \"pumping the stock price\" is a common misconception, but not actually true (unless the buyback is executed at prices lower than fair value). There are less shares outstanding afterwards, but there is also less cash, so if executed at fair prices there is no reason for the stock price to move. Just think through an example of a simple company which is a pot of $1000, and can get 10% returns on it. There are 100 shares, so if investors want 10% returns, shares should trade at 10$ (P/B = 1). If the company repurchases half the shares, there will be only 50 shares but the company only has 500$ now, making each share still worth 10$ for 10% hurdle rates. reply robertlagrant 9 hours agorootparentprev> They're a means of \"returning money\", but they also pump up the stock price, to which managers' TCs are linked. Hence they are a form of manipulation. Why would you say they're pumping up the stock price, rather than just raising the price? Is it a temporary pumping effect, like an Elon Musk tweet from 2017, or is it actually increasing the value of the remaining shares? reply thehappypm 7 hours agorootparentLet's say corp XYZ has 100 shares out, and they're owned by 50 people. At any point, there are people trading, buying and selling those 100 shares. Buyer 51 comes along and wants to buy a share. He can only buy a share if one of the 50 owners are selling. So, he has to offer a price that'll convince one of the 50 to sell. XYZ Corp decides to do a buyback. They buy 20 of those shares. In that moment, they will certainly create a spike in demand for the 20 shares. But later on, now there are only 80 shares out. When buyer 52 comes along to buy a share, there are fewer shares, and fewer sellers. He might have to offer more than Buyer 51 to actually get a share for that reason. reply tzs 6 hours agorootparent> But later on, now there are only 80 shares out.

Pumping stock is artificially increasing the number of buyers, for a short period. You're describing reducing the number of sellers. Which may increase the price, or may not. reply thehappypm 6 hours agorootparentYou could argue that the buyback itself, like the moment where the company actually buys the shares back, is a pump moment. they could have the demand far outstrip the typical demand in the moment. But long-term, the price should be higher as they have decreased supply. reply concinds 8 hours agorootparentprevProbably only the latter. My point was that executives (share sellers) benefit and it creates potentially toxic incentives. reply kjreact 7 hours agorootparentExecutives are always incentivized to increase share value; that’s their job. Note: it’s the board of directors that issues new shares not executives. Executives can sit on the board, but the two are not the same. Executives are actually appointed by the board. The reason stock buybacks are viewed somewhat negatively is because it’s a lazy way to increase share value. Preferably executives would use the money to come up with new products/services to increase revenues. But if we’re talking about huge mega corporations, who already spend a lot of money on R&D, capex and/or acquisitions, then using some additional cash flow on buybacks makes sense. In Intel’s case, the buyback merits some discussion because it is implied that government subsidies are being used to buyback shares which is not the intention of the subsidy. Edit: IMO, I don’t think Intel underinvested, I believe they invested in many failed ventures and under their past and current leadership they are not able to grow the company in any meaningful way. reply robertlagrant 7 hours agorootparentprev> My point was that executives (share sellers) benefit and it creates potentially toxic incentives.

Same with Boeing (161% of Boeing profits given to shareholders 2013-2019, underinvestment in talent and safety). reply fiprofessor 9 hours agoparentprevPrior to the Bush era tax cuts, all dividends were taxed at the income rate, which I think explains the biggest motivation in the shift from dividends to buybacks in that era. Nowadays, as you say, there is no difference in tax rates for qualified dividends. However, one big remaining benefit of buybacks is that a dividend forces one to incur a taxable event when the dividend is issued, even if one chooses to immediately re-invest the dividend in the company (as many people still in the accumulation phase of investing do). On the other hand, a buyback does not force those people to sell. On the other hand, a buyback should lower the market cap of a stock, so cap-weighted index funds ought to sell and re-balance when a buyback is issued, so most index investors would seemingly end up selling. However, they end up being able to avoid most of the capital gains taxes by re-balancing through redemptions and heartbeat trades. reply gizmondo 8 hours agorootparent> On the other hand, a buyback should lower the market cap of a stock You got it backwards. If a stock is priced fairly, a buyback is value-neutral. Reduction of the cash on hand is offset by the increase of future cash flow per share. It's dividends that reduce the market cap. reply fiprofessor 8 hours agorootparentNo, because the future cash flow per share is not reflected in the current market cap. Perhaps you are thinking of share price instead: there it is true that dividends reduce share price, while buybacks are share-price neutral at least theoretically, though it is commonly believed by many people that they do affect price. (Hence, under that same theoretical model, market cap must decrease if share price remains the same because market cap is total number of outstanding shares * share price. So if the former decreases while the latter stays the same, market cap must have decreased.) reply gizmondo 8 hours agorootparentYou're right, I need a coffee. reply otteromkram 8 hours agorootparentprev> On the other hand, a buyback should lower the market cap of a stock [...] Uhh...what?

But this is (at least theoretically) offset by the fact that the firm's assets have decreased. For example, if the buyback was paid for with cash, then prior to the buyback, the shares represented a claim of ownership not just on future earnings, but also on that cash reserve. That said, this is all under a theoretical model (as in Miller-Modigliani theorem). In practice/empirically, there is reason to plausibly believe that e.g. the decision to announce a buyback has a signalling effect and so can increase share prices. reply mrkstu 5 hours agorootparentIs there a heuristic for how much of the value of a share is assigned to asset value vs forward looking earnings?

CEOs are constantly attempting to manipulate the stock price by trying their best to do a good job. reply daft_pink 8 hours agoparentprevJust want to mention since many commentors on this seem to miss this, three important points about stock buybacks missed by the back and forth partisan talking points on this comment: 1. They only make sense when the stock is undervalued and aren’t purely driven by taxes. If the stock is undervalued, then investors benefit by owning more of the company for less. If the stock is overvalued, then investors don’t benefit. The overall value of the price compared to its long term real value is important. There is a basic problem with this, because company executives probably never want to admit that their stock is overvalued. 2. Companies with strong incomes relative to their price can afford to do buybacks or with strong cash positions are the ones that make sense to do buybacks. Companies like this might be overvalued. When you see companies internet companies with zero income doing buybacks it makes very little sense and only established companies. Companies with strong financial positions relative to their stock price are more likely to be undervalued. 3. Because of the discounted cash value of income model for dividends where the value of a stock is based on future income and cash flow, dividends generally have to be stable and regular to ascribe significant value to a stock, which is why companies that have built up large cash balances but don’t expect to regularly pay dividends opt for buybacks, because they don’t want to create the constant pressure to regularly pay dividends. reply nr378 8 hours agorootparent1. Stock buybacks are always anti-dilutive regardless of the value of the stock, and so investors always benefit as future earnings are concentrated amongst fewer shares (all other things being equal). It's true that a lower price/value increases the magnitude of this effect, but the effect is always present. 2. Zero income stocks can still do buybacks when they're returning capital raised from shareholders to shareholders (this is essentially just partially reversing a funding round, which again undoes some of the dilution). 3. Companies can be deemed to be significantly valuable without paying any dividends. Companies that have a long history of paying dividends but then suddenly stop tend to be in distress, which is then reflected in their share price. reply daft_pink 6 hours agorootparentThese statements might be logically true, but I feel the logic ignores the overall strategic factors involved in buying back stock and that management needs to consider whether the stock is over or under valued, whether earnings are strong enough for this to make logical sense and the supply and demand among investors for dividend stocks and the ultimate value of a single lump sum distributed to investors vs the value of increased future earnings to the investor from the anti-dilutive impact of buying back stock.

I believe it should be legal, it's an efficient way to increase share value without adding to someone's income, thus often carries no immediate taxable obligation. However one could argue that these methods of moving wealth around without taxable events triggering adds to the fuel for calls to tax unrealised gains on all stock.

But that’s how we run the United States now. There’s no longer comprehensive legislation trying to solve a particular (perceived) problem. Instead we just drop money from the sky on various people and companies. There’s a pandemic? Quick, cut 80% of the country a check. The childcare industry is structurally understaffed and unprofitable, let’s just cut them all checks! Higher education keeps on growing to larger and larger percentages of GDP? That’s okay we’ll just cut checks blank tuition checks and then forgive all the loans. China is signaling that it might invade Taiwan. That’s a tough one. Hmm.

Take loan forgiveness—-the loans themselves are not the underlying root issue. They are a tertiary effect of a credentialism spiral and insane cost growth at institutions that don’t face true market pressures. Just dropping money on borrowers is not even attempting to fix the underlying problem. It’s so unambitious it invites cynicism. reply ethanbond 8 hours agorootparentAnd how do you propose the government try to fix credentialism? For all the talk about how useless degrees are, companies still choose to require them, especially the companies helmed by “college is a scam” zealots. reply bradleyjg 8 hours agorootparentCompanies have to still require them because they are a valuable signal and it’s free to them. Kids have to go because companies require them. This is what a peacock spiral looks like. Government is fundamentally for breaking these kind of incentive failures. Not supercharging them through blank check forgivable loans. reply ethanbond 8 hours agorootparentNo, companies don’t have to require them. Agreed the loan behavior exacerbates the issue rather than mitigates it, but “the current solution is bad” doesn’t necessarily mean the same agent is able to produce a good solution. If you’re certain the government is capable of breaking it: how? reply bradleyjg 8 hours agorootparentI have ideas but if I post them, I’m guessing you are going to pattern match me to some ideological category and try to debate from that point of view. That’s not my point at all. It’s that all our federal politicians and political parties have had their ambitions shrunk down to nothing. No one at all is saying—-hey this credentialism thing is a serious problem, vote for us and here’s how we’ll attack it. Even if someone was proposing an idea I totally hated, I would at least appreciate the effort to actually solve a real problem. If you think credentialism is impossible for the government to make a difference on, pick something else. Anywhere you look for the last 14 years we’ve had few to no ambitious proposals. reply ethanbond 6 hours agorootparentErrmmm... okay. The Biden administration actually has both talked extensively and taken several concrete steps against credentialism. Effective? I personally do not know. But it's blatantly false to say no one is talking about it or attempting to fix it. > The Department of Labor (DOL) is announcing an Advanced Manufacturing Registered Apprenticeship Accelerator Series that will support hundreds of employers to speed the development and launch of Registered Apprenticeship programs in high-demand occupations, such as industrial manufacturing technicians, robotics technicians, and industrial maintenance mechanics. Since the beginning of this Administration, the number of apprentices in advanced manufacturing Registered Apprenticeship programs has increased by 10 percent—and this effort will build on that growth. The administration has backed numerous apprenticeship programs like BioFabUSA that explicitly do not require college degrees. The administration created \"Investing in America Workforce Hubs\" in several cities to attract private investment into programs that, again, prioritize high-quality jobs that do not require college degrees. So it is simply untrue that no one is saying credentialism is a problem and trying to attack it. The current administration talks about this to no end and has attempted dozens and dozens of substantial attacks on it. Again, if you have ideas other than grant funding and tax incentives, I'm truly curious to hear them. reply lossolo 8 hours agorootparentprevYou still do not offer any alternative solutions to problems you presented in your original post. reply vasco 8 hours agorootparentprevThanks for ellaborating! Although de-regulation and regulation have other properties, I'd posit they are in essense are forms of capital allocation. When you regulate an industry you require more capital investment from that industry, either by investing in new processes, implementing compliance mechanisms, maybe hiring extra quality-assurance people or having to dispose of trash in a better way, etc. Regulation mostly implies more investment by the participants in that specific segment of the market, it's like a reverse capital injection, or an added tax. The same way de-regulation is like giving that segment of the market a cash bonus because they can relax processes that require money to run and operate more efficiently. More importantly regulation and deregulation also add or remove rules, so they change the behavior of the participants. If you want to have the same effect of regulation and deregulation but not by driving change in rules of operation (maybe because as the government you don't know yet which rules to create - or the different political factions cannot agree), an easier way is to directly give money, and depending on how you allocate it, I think it can be a fair way to do it. Another way of thinking about this as a system is imagining the case where you want to promote investment in the semi-conductor industry but not at the expense of processes. Said another way, what would you de-regulate in the semiconductor industry to have the same effect as a capital injection to the leading semiconductor companies in your country? Surely you're not proposing them to be able to use more dangerous chemicals and dispose them however they want, or other types of de-regulation? It would reduce the barriers to entry and help semiconductor companies, but with negative externalities. Messing with regulations always has this potential for unpredictable secondary effects. I'm not convinced regulation/deregulation is in principle superior to just allocating money pools with fair rules to access them. I'm obviously against nepotism and influence peddling as part of the money allocation process and I'm not defending the injection into Intel specifically, which probably suffered from a big amount of influence peddling. reply wakawaka28 7 hours agorootparentprevTuition has only exploded because of unlimited government-backed student loans. They created this problem with the \"good intentions\" of providing everyone an opportunity to study any subject at any price regardless of job prospects. The problem isn't credentialism per se, although a large number of people were advised to go to college for the most generic stuff on the theory that \"any\" college degree doubles your lifetime earnings no matter what you study. reply YetAnotherNick 7 hours agorootparentprevRegulations is one of the major reason semiconductor industry shifted overseas. US used to be the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing. If you think Intel will stay regardless of US regulation, you are definitely wrong. China will always allow manufacturing with minimal regulations. reply Drakim 9 hours agorootparentprevThe government as the strongest central power identifying weak or struggling areas of the country that needs help makes sense.

Of course, there is, but some problems are different and difficult. Why are they difficult? Because it's hard to find an alternative solution that ticks all these boxes: one that is socially acceptable to all parties involved, does not incur additional problems or direct costs to any specific party or group of interest, and does not disrupt the market, among other considerations. You also need to take into account current laws, the social contract, and politics. Sometimes, the most efficient, easiest, least disruptive, and most acceptable solution is simply to allocate funds to address the problem. reply overstay8930 9 hours agoparentprev“Raising children is expensive, let’s make sure we make it even worse for them by removing our strategic autonomy!” You’re free to believe what you want, but you should probably reevaluate your position when it’s parroting 1:1 what Chinese bots are spreading. reply shortsunblack 8 hours agoprevIf Intel is so important to national security, it should be nationalized. If Intel is not willing to willingly invest into U.S. manufacturing, it can be targeted with tariffs. A corporate handout by the taxpayer is not what should happen, though. And yes, stock buybacks are a form of market manipulation. That's why they were banned before Reagan. Funnily enough, SEC unbanned stock buybacks by using the Chevron deference, which is currently being challenged in courts. EPA being unable to regulate climate change might be offsetted by a minor win of making SEC not ignore law anymore by asserting its legitimacy. reply prepend 8 hours agoparentNationalizing is unlikely to increase productivity and innovation. There’s multiple competing goals here and we need to think about how to achieve them. If we think that Intel is fixed and unlikely to need to change, perhaps nationalize and then just operate it as it slowly declines. But that’s also going to make other chip companies less likely to invest in the US as few investors want their investments nationalized. The purpose of these economic investments isn’t primarily moral justice (although I think that should be part of the calculation). The purpose is to increase US chip production. It seems quite silly to think that nationalizing Intel would lead to greater US chip production. reply shortsunblack 7 hours agorootparentChina is banning Intel and AMD chips from their gov't use. When they catch up with tsmc in 7nm, they'll likely make an import ban on all U.S. chips. Who then will AMD and Intel sell to? Aging European population? Africa as it develops? Africans are likely to buy Chinese chips, seeing for all the material infrastructure China invests in. Intel and AMD will only sell to American-alligned countries, which are declining. Seizing the company and milking till it runs dry is the right move. Intel had all the capital it needed to innovate. It did not. The company is unable, despite all the cash it has on hand. It's a lost cause. One hopes AMD continues innovating. reply constantcrying 6 hours agorootparentThis is completely delusional. China isn't the entire world and trashing your own manufacturing because one market might somewhat soon see increased competition is a legitimately insane policy proposal. Also Intel did innovate, very clearly so and they don't compete with AMD when it comes to manufacturing at all. reply shortsunblack 6 hours agorootparentAMD has 1.5x larger market cap than Intel. All in 7 or so years where it was near bankruptcy. During AMD's weakness, Intel had near monopoly position on chips. It racked up all the cash it could. It hasn't innovated ever since. Chiplets came from AMD, 6 cores as minimum standard came from AMD (Intel sold 4 core entry CPUs well into Zen era because that's all you need!). Affordable motherboards (together with partners) and strong commitment to socket longevity came from AMD (AM4 is still supported and new products with 5600x3d are still released). In reference, Intel before AMD's Zen would release a new socket for each yearly release. And in fabs, Intel just isn't nowhere close. How's the 12nm++++++++++++ going? China is 5.2B of AMD's sales (2022). That's 65% of U.S.' with enormous growth potential as Chinese middle class gets richer. Europe is 1.77B of AMD's revenue. How does the capex investment equation play out when your 5.5B of sales just disappears into thin air? reply constantcrying 6 hours agorootparentMarket caps are literally made up by how investors feel. Intel and AMD aren't competitors in manufacturing semiconductors, as in they literally do not compete in that market. AMD isn't manufacturing, they are totally irrelevant when it comes to the discussion. >It hasn't innovated ever since. What are you on about? This is ridiculous. Do you know anything at all about this subject. reply sloowm 7 hours agoparentprevThe main problem of course is that the US government is so dependent on a single company because they allowed the instruction set to be protected IP since forever, allowed imports from countries without demanding they provide the same labor and environmental protections and they didn't invest in a well educated population that would allow for new advancements to be homegrown. If the buybacks are undesirable they should tax them. If Intel is trying to divest they should start working towards alternatives and put the government contracts towards companies that do not create these issues. reply Workaccount2 7 hours agorootparentThe instruction set has nothing to do with semiconductor fabrication...

If its material is a different question, I'd argue it is but don't have data to back that up. If a company has to buy back 10 billion in stock over a fixed time period market participates should be able to drive up the stock price knowing they will have a buyer (the company) to sell to later. reply nabla9 7 hours agorootparentLets go this trough: Before: I own 100 stocks worth $100 each. =$10000. Option 1: 2% dividend. I have 100 stocks worth $98 each + $200 =$10000. Stock value drops immediately. Option 2: equal sized buyback: I have 100 stocks worth of $100 each = $1000. Buyback does not increase the stock value immediately. Company pays $200 for those who sell, but owns the stocks (or shareholders 'own them') so it's net neutral. This reduces the number of shares outstanding, thereby inflating (positive) future earnings per share. This typically leads to the value increasing. reply maxerickson 5 hours agorootparentprevBeing taxed differently is pretty significant. Kind of weird to impose a tax and then also have an easy way around it. reply nabla9 3 hours agorootparentIt just delays taxation. It's more important for small investors in the US, because in the US even index funds must pay tax for dividends. Here in EU we can buy US index funds not available for US citizens where dividends are reinvested without tax. For us it does not matter that much. reply maxerickson 34 minutes agorootparentIn a hand wavy theoretical sense you can maybe say it \"just\" delays taxation, but shareholders aren't going to go out of their way to ensure that they sell at a price that incurs the equivalent taxation. And then a tax that sort of directly relates back to the cashflow of the company is not equivalent to a tax that is based on the capital gains that shareholders end up with. reply wakawaka28 8 hours agoparentprevIt would be unfair to only put tariffs on Intel.

It's still subject to taxation via capital gains tax. Subsidy is just a way to create an incentive for Intel to build manufacturing facilities in the US. It's not paid because Intel lacks funds, but to ensure that factories are built in the US and not elsewhere. Intel can do whatever it wants with the money received from subsidies, provided it fulfills its obligations. Jobs aren't particularly important in this schema, but they are a nice talking point for politicians to show that at least part of the money paid via subsidies will return to American workers. reply specialist 6 hours agoparentAs stated elsethread, buybacks defer taxation.

I always thought of \"stock buybacks\" as a form of \"debt payment\". Stocks are created by companies out of thin air, as a tech worker I am (partially) paid in stocks. Those stocks aren't purchased by my company on the open market, they are manifested -- diluting shareholder stock. Buybacks put a payment on that \"loan\".

But is what I said wrong? Isn't stock being continually issued, diluting the value over time? If buybacks were _never_ done, wouldn't it keep getting diluted forever? Edit: for instance, if Google has 200,000 employees and is granting an average of $50,000 stock per year, that is $10 billion. So id be okay with buybacks of that size. The actual buybacks are much bigger if memory serves, so that seems like manipulation like you're saying reply spicyusername 9 hours agorootparentOne thing that bothers me about the current economy is that most tech workers are are paid in stock and most Americans are required to invest to retire. This is basically a net fiscal transfer from regular Americans to tech workers, since tech stocks are typically the default investment when retirement is more than a decade away, artificially raising the price of tech stocks.

The forum was launched on March 2021 and since then has seen 100,000+ posts by over 20,000 users. Given the size and concentration of topics on the forum, it is a great resource for understanding the general sentiment of developers, identify common problems and rabbit holes users face and gather feedback on OpenAI products. In order to get deeper insights to developer experience and shared sentiment about certain products, we downloaded all the posts from common categories from the forum, namely. The following categories and their relevant sub-categories are included: API API/Bugs API/Deprecations API/Feedback GPT Builders GPT Builders/Chat-Plugins GPT Builders/Plugin-Store Prompting Community Documentation We created a dataset of all posts and discussions in the above categories which took place on the forum till 28th February 2024. 🤗 HuggingFace Link But... why? We believe there's a lot to learn from what people are struggling with, the developer sentiment over experience with using OpenAI's products. This dataset was made so that we could answer these questions. There's a lot potential in learning from OpenAI's mistakes and successes. We at Julep would love to hear what you built from the dataset! Hit us up on X/Twitter or email. Getting data from Discourse Every Discourse Discussion returns data in JSON if you append .json to the URL. Discussion URL: https://community.openai.com/t/{discussion_id} Discussion in JSON: https://community.openai.com/t/{discussion_id}.json Discussion in Markdown: https://community.openai.com/raw/{discussion_id} Raw data was gathered into a single JSONL file by automating a browser using Playwright. Let's walk through how the dataset was made and then showcase some initial trends we noticed. Feature Engineering Brief walkthrough to engineering the features. Since each row had one Discussion and each Discussion had multiple Posts in a thread, the dataset needed to be normalised to the post level; which were features of an individual post and post_discussion level; which were features of the discussion the post belonged to. For eg; Post-level features: post_id; post_author Discussion-level features: post_discussion_id; post_category_id In [ ]:%matplotlib widget In [ ]:import pandas as pd from datasets import Dataset, load_from_disk, load_dataset # hf_dataset = load_from_disk(\"9_dataset_with_topics\") hf_dataset = load_dataset(\"julep-ai/openai-community-posts\") df = hf_dataset.to_pandas() In [ ]:hf_dataset.features Out[ ]:{'post_discussion_id': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_discussion_tags': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='string', id=None), length=-1, id=None), 'post_discussion_title': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_discussion_created_at': Value(dtype='timestamp[ns, tz=UTC]', id=None), 'post_category_id': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_discussion_views': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_discussion_reply_count': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_discussion_like_count': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_discussion_participant_count': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_discussion_word_count': Value(dtype='float64', id=None), 'post_id': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_author': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_created_at': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_content': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_read_count': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_reply_count': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_author_id': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_number': Value(dtype='int64', id=None), 'post_discussion_related_topics': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='int64', id=None), length=-1, id=None), 'accepted_answer_post': Value(dtype='float64', id=None), 'post_content_raw': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_category_name': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_sentiment': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_sentiment_score': Value(dtype='float64', id=None), 'post_content_cluster_embedding': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='float64', id=None), length=-1, id=None), 'post_content_classification_embedding': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='float64', id=None), length=-1, id=None), 'post_content_search_document_embedding': Sequence(feature=Value(dtype='float64', id=None), length=-1, id=None), 'tag1': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'tag2': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'tag3': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'tag4': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_discussion_url': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'post_url': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'topic_model_medium': Value(dtype='string', id=None), 'topic_model_broad': Value(dtype='string', id=None)} In [ ]:# Total number of posts print(\"Total number of posts: \", len(df)) # Total discussions print(\"Total discussions: \", len(df[\"post_discussion_id\"].unique())) # Total number of users print(\"Total number of users: \", len(df[\"post_author_id\"].unique())) Total number of posts: 97033 Total discussions: 18990 Total number of users: 21419 In [ ]:# Earliest and latest post print(\"Earliest post: \", df[\"post_created_at\"].min()) print(\"Latest post: \", df[\"post_created_at\"].max()) Earliest post: 2021-03-10T20:39:25.848Z Latest post: 2024-02-27T14:03:01.685Z Apart from Post and Discussion level features, the following class features were computed; Sentiment Vector Embeddings Topic Models Twitter-roBERTa-base Sentiment Using Twitter-roBERTa-base for sentiment analysis, we generated a post_sentiment label (negative, positive, neutral) and post_sentiment_score confidence score for each post.

Wrapping up We've just began to scratch the surface to useful data that can be analysed about OpenAI's products, launches, tools and the trends surrounding their usage. This post is meant to be an introduction to the dataset and show some threads that can be explored further. We at Julep AI are building an open-source platform for crafting AI Agents. In the spirit of open-source, we decided to make this dataset public in hopes of helping out other people identify the cracks and the gaps that OpenAI cannot fix, doesn't want to fix or is opinionated against. Given the activity of the community and the ease of downloading the data, it made perfect sense to leverage this low-hanging fruit of knowledge. We hope that this dataset helps other people building AI stacks. We'd love to hear more about how you used the dataset or just talk in general!

The REST API documentation is good, and just using it in your HTTP client of choice like requests is roughly the same LOC without unexpected issues, along with more control. reply rockostrich 4 hours agorootparentI've found this happens with a lot of first party clients. At work, we use LaunchDarkly for feature flags and use their code references tool to keep track of where flags are being referenced. The tool uses their first party Go client to interact with the API but the client doesn't handle rate limiting at all even though they have rate limiting headers clearly documented for their API. reply doctorpangloss 3 hours agoparentprevThe Python package is really well engineered, and the startup that is making the OpenAPI client based on it, Stainless, is doing a good job. This shows laypeople piling into a hype thing and running immediately into the roadblock of programming. Normal people don't want to like, put in effort to feel like they are a part of something. They are used to \"just\" having to turn on Netflix to feel like they are a part of the biggest TV show, or \"just\" having to click a button to buy a Stanley Cup, or \"just\" having to click a button to buy Bitcoin. The API and performance issues, IMO, they're not noise, but they are meaningless. To me this also signals how badly Grok and Stability are doing it, they are doubling and tripling down on popular opinions that have a strong, objective meaninglessness to them (like how fast the tokens come out and how much porn you're allowed to make). Whereas the Grok people are looking at this analysis and feeling very validated right now. I have no dog in this race, but I would hope that the OpenAI people do not waste any time on Python APIs for dumb people; instead, they should definitely improve their store and have a firmer opinion on how that would look. They almost certainly have a developing opinion on a programming paradigm for chatbots, but I feel like they are hamstrung by needed to quantize their models to meet demand, not decisions about the look and feel of Python APIs or the crappiness of the Python packaging ecosystem. Another POV is that the Apple development experience persists to be notoriously crappy, and yet they are the most valuable platform for most companies in the world right now; and also, JetBrains could not sustain an audience for the AppCode IDE, because everyone uses middlewares anyway; so I really don't think Python APIs matter as much as the community says they do. It's a Nice to Have, but it Does Not Matter. reply enonimal 3 hours agorootparentwe may think more similarly than you seem to think... this was more a slam on python packaging in general, than it is on the OpenAI implementation. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the issues under this topic are more related to Python package version nightmares, than OpenAI's Python implementation itself. reply dorkwood 4 hours agoprevI did a bit of data scraping for fun in the past, but I was never quite sure of the legality of what I was doing.

There was a workaround that consisted of running the program that would resume from the latest save, then exiting to the main menu. If you had a large enough hard-drive, you could also run it by copying the data to your hard drive, then manually pointing the game at the path (thus allowing you to omit the CD-ROM driver).

Love your profile text, by the way. EDIT: one quick example is that I’ve lost more data by forgetting passwords than I care to admit. They’ve all been from an age where I thought it was a good idea to encrypt my secret documents, lest prying eyes get to them. Turns out the secrets would’ve been interesting to me, but are no longer accessible. I suspect this isn’t uncommon. reply hedora 6 hours agorootparentEven if you don't care about all your data being published in the future, and even if you don't care about getting your data deleted (or door knocked in) because of a random content scanner false positive, you still need to encrypt them. Many cloud storage services try to understand and then \"clean up\" file types they understand. If you don't believe me, upload and then download a TB or so of images, documents, music, videos, etc. Then, compare the checksums of the original and restored copies. On top of that, there are services like Amazon Cloud Drive that have content-type restrictions. The only reasonable litmus test I've seen in this space is \"there is a cryptographic proof that some middle manager didn't screw up my backup\". Unfortunately, that means you need to manage the encryption keys somehow. Cloud storage kind of sucks. reply Hizonner 4 hours agorootparentprev> I’ve lost more data by forgetting passwords than I care to admit This is a you problem. 100 percent PEBKAC. I've been encrypting every backup, local and cloud, and plenty of other things, for probably 30 years. I've done my share of restores, and have never lost the only key to anything I later wanted back. That's true even though I have forgotten a few passwords, because I had failsafes for that situation. This requires memorizing only three or four long passwords, which change very rarely, plus a little bit of discipline and occasionally some maintenance of your archives. On the other hand, putting something somewhere, like some cloud service, without seeing all the implications, is a mistake that's easy to make and hard to clean up. Storing stuff in the cloud in the clear en masse is an insane thing to make into a normal part of your routine. reply smarx007 37 minutes agorootparentMany cases where a recovery from backup is needed are due to PEBKAC. reply giantg2 6 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds like a password management problem and not a problem with encryption. reply philote 6 hours agorootparentprevPlease go into detail, I'm curious how encrypting your backups has more problems than benefits. reply planb 7 hours agorootparentprevReally?

Google Drive and Apple iCloud advertise themselves as a safe place to keep all of your data, and will nag users of Android and iOS devices respectively into enabling their storage services, setting them as the default storage provider for documents, and enabling automatic deletion of local copies to \"free up space\". They want users to rely on them for all of their photo/note/mosc documents storage and synchronization needs, it's good for their business if they do. But they also don't want to store anything questionable and be held legally responsible, so they automatically scan all of the \"safely stored\" documents, and purge users who get flagged. So their business incentives align such that they - coerce as many users as possible to become maximally dependent on their services - retract those service that users depend on for any slight or potential liability and if business incentives say you do something, you do it, and no amount of techies informing the masses is going to outperform Google or Apple's messaging. So how do we fix this? We change the incentives; if you delete someone's data you should be punished. They trusted you with it, they may have even paid you to store it.

You see it especially in TikTok videos. When people aren’t straight up censoring themselves with bleeps, dead audio, or cuts, they use euphemisms instead: kill -> unalive, rape -> grape, sex -> seggs. Even more concerning is that what is considered in need of censoring is expanding. I saw a video where the creator censored “white” when referring to Caucasians. reply Cthulhu_ 7 hours agoparentPart of it is feared censoring / demotion in the algorithms; part is hypersensitivity / hyperconsiderate, because some people have indicated they are triggered by certain words, and I'm guessing another part is maximising reach. That is, if you use explicit language, your content may be marked as 12, 16, 18+ content, and half your engagement may drop because people in comment sections seriously underestimate how much \"engagement\" a teenager with a phone and infinite time generates. reply vsnf 7 hours agorootparentYes, those are the the proximate causes. I'm worried about the effect these causes will induce going forward. With enough time, this expanded hypersensitivity will move out of TikTok and into wider culture permanently. reply somedude895 7 hours agoparentprevYou see that on Youtube as well.

Instagram has the screenshots at least: https://www.instagram.com/sloan_spencer_author/p/C48JN_TrvxO... It does look like the author just lost access to docs they shared with others, not their entire account. Author is currently appealing. We have seen this kind of thing in the past. Drive has to be careful, as people will use private drive links and doc links (could have embedded images) to share explicit material that may be illegal. From my understanding, Google will start running some kind of automation against things when they are shared with other people if they might contain things that could be illegal. I have no idea what the heuristics are, or how often they get it wrong. But they are kind of between a rock and a hard place. Googler, opinions are my own. reply gcr 7 hours agoparentAuthor’s last screenshot states that her whole account was frozen just after submitting the appeal and she no longer has access to her docs.

The classic \"smutty writing magazines\" of old were still on the over 18 shelf in the magazine store. Some states may further restrict this and go after the distributor or publisher ( https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3/BillText/er/PDF ) (e) \"Material harmful to minors\" means any material that: 1. The average person applying contemporary community standards would find, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; 2. Depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct as specifically defined in s. 847.001(19); and ... Media type is not defined - text may be interested to fall within that definition. Google is also a multi-national company and would need to comply with laws in other countries too. If the individuals are represented as being minors (again, changes with jurisdictions) this gets into further complications in many places. That share links are neither checked for age nor jurisdiction, google would be liable for knowingly distributing sexually explicit material without proper checks in place to limit consumption by minors or in jurisdictions where such content is restricted. reply nickelpro 7 hours agoprevMisleading title, none of the authors involved are claiming they're locked out of the accounts. The exact quote from the OP's mastadon is \"An author lost access to her explicit writing when she shared it with alpha and beta readers.\" Google says you may not use its services to distribute sexually explicit content. This is a very common and reasonable policy. The authors violated that rule, and while none of them are being straightforward about exactly what happened what seems to be the case is the violating content has been removed/locked. reply gcr 7 hours agoparentThat’s not what the author wrote.

I should have considered that when submitting. However, the point about downloading to her laptop is consistent with her story. Here's what we definitively know: 1. First, something about her ability to share her docs was disabled, but in a way that still left them accessible to her; 2. She then submitted an appeal; 3. Upon submitting the appeal, her account was summarily frozen pending review, and her docs were no longer accessible to her. reply aqme28 7 hours agoparentprevI understand the idea behind banning sexually explicit writing, but that basically means that large large percentage of literature cannot use Google services. Anyone writing a novel basically shouldn’t use docs in case they might someday want to include sex in their writing. reply nickelpro 7 hours agorootparentGoogle's policy doesn't say anything about using their services to create sexually explicit content, only using their services for distribution. > Do not distribute content that contains sexually explicit material, such as nudity, graphic sex acts, and pornographic material. This includes driving traffic to commercial pornography sites. We allow nudity for educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purposes. This squares with what happened to the authors here, who were only subject to enforcement actions when they shared the content via Google Docs.

Restoring from a backup doesn't work either because it thinks I'm trying to downgrade the version, which isn't supported. I just spun up a new instance, I'll see if keeping it simple works for me.

Failure to do so would result in the business being dissolved, this clause would mainly be to protect stakeholders who go out of business and can't afford to maintain backups. This would work similarly to how a bank must be FDIC insured to lend out its customer deposits. Data is money in the information age and needs similar protections, especially with the rise of AI and profits generated from derivative works. A business which refuses to follow this law would be unaccredited, meaning that Google would be unaccredited in this case, so probably nobody should be using their services. IANAL, but personally I might extend this to work something like personally identifiable information (PII) laws, where all of the user's data is considered private, but part or all of it may be shared publicly under the TOS which the user agrees to. The sharing would be at the discretion of the business, but the data would always belong to the user under copyright law until proven otherwise. The process of proving copyright ownership would first require full sharing of the data back to the user under court discovery laws. The crux of the matter is that we have laws preventing the sharing of PII, but to my knowledge we don't have laws that protect access to a user's own information. Which seems doubly odd since companies profit from that data. Holding a user's data for ransom so that a business can make money from it seems akin to extortion, although I can't find the exact word for it.

You seem to be relying on the idea that Google might have been legally required to act against child pornography, so the \"it\" that would have to be true would be that the text was in fact child pornography. As far as I can find, US child pornography laws don't mention or apply to pure text. Even if the unsubstantiated rumor you're spreading were true, then the unsubstantiated claim underlying it still could not possibly be true. Any automated system or set of procedures that acts on the impossible supposition that a pure text document could even possibly be \"child pornography\" under those laws is automatically wrong. ... and the more credible claim is that the suspension was for \"sexually explicit content\", not \"illegal child pornography\", or the ever-popular \"illegal obscenity\", or illegal anything. That's a purely voluntary choice by Google. And even if that weren't true in this case, it is definitely true in many, many others. > what else was google supposed to do here? For the legal side, notice that text can never be \"child pornography\" in the US, and have it actually read for violations of any other law you're worried about by somebody who's actually qualified to evaluate its legal status and actually taking the time to do so. For the \"completely voluntarily chosen Google policy\" side, which is the one that actually seems to be at stake here, hold off on doing anything until the material has been reviewed by a human who actually understands the issues, actually has authority to make meaningful decisions, and has the time and motivation to do so. Also, don't adopt pointless, silly policies. Of course, commercial incentives assure that Google won't do any of that. And neither will any other provider of a similar cloud service. So what every single user should do is get the hell off of all of those services. That would be a good idea even if policies weren't silly and if policy enforcement weren't hair-trigger, error-prone, capricious garbage, but it's especially important because this and other stories give every reason to believe that they are. On all of them. That applies even if there is no commercially viable approach to handling these issues correctly. If a service can't be offered in any reasonable way, then that service should not be offered, or at least should not be used. \"What are they supposed to do?\" isn't a valid reason to use an unreliable, dangerous service. ... and the \"story\" is that many, many people are in fact using dangerous systems and should be moving off of them. reply rasengan 7 hours agoprevIf you're not self hosting in 2024, you're doing it wrong.

I really don't understand why Google (and Western society) condones this sort of content while having a near zero-tolerance policy towards sex and love. But I figured it out today: violent media re-directs our rage against the unsustainable culture and gives it an outlet. I'm not bashing on violent entertainment BTW: I like martial arts movies. But it does have a deeper function: to give us a sense of justice (good versus bad), and distract us away from the atrocities of consumerism (destruction of the planet which gave us life). In short, violent media HELPS global capitalism and its destructiveness. Then why is sex banned? Yes, we can look for the superficial reasons, like \"oooh, parents don't want their kids to view this stuff\". But that does not even apply here, especially because this was in a private Google docs. No, sex is treated harshly because it is primal and goes against civilization: it represents a more primal human connection, and human connection is antithetical to consumerism and the destruction of the environment. Yes, we can also look for historical religious reasons, but there is a reason why such religious motivation survived, and other religious practices do NOT: any social practice which survives does so because it confers benefits to those who promote the practice.

    "originBody": "NEWS 27 March 2024 Correction 27 March 2024 Memories are made by breaking DNA — and fixing it Nerve cells form long-term memories with the help of an inflammatory response, study in mice finds. By Max Kozlov Twitter Facebook Email Neurons (shown here in a coloured scanning electron micrograph) mend broken DNA during memory formation. Credit: Ted Kinsman/Science Photo Library When a long-term memory forms, some brain cells experience a rush of electrical activity so strong that it snaps their DNA. Then, an inflammatory response kicks in, repairing this damage and helping to cement the memory, a study in mice shows. The findings, published on 27 March in Nature1, are “extremely exciting”, says Li-Huei Tsai, a neurobiologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who was not involved in the work. They contribute to the picture that forming memories is a “risky business”, she says. Normally, breaks in both strands of the double helix DNA molecule are associated with diseases including cancer. But in this case, the DNA damage-and-repair cycle offers one explanation for how memories might form and last. It also suggests a tantalizing possibility: this cycle might be faulty in people with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, causing a build-up of errors in a neuron’s DNA, says study co-author Jelena Radulovic, a neuroscientist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Inflammatory response This isn’t the first time that DNA damage has been associated with memory. In 2021, Tsai and her colleagues showed that double-stranded DNA breaks are widespread in the brain, and linked them with learning2. To better understand the part these DNA breaks play in memory formation, Radulovic and her colleagues trained mice to associate a small electrical shock with a new environment, so that when the animals were once again put into that environment, they would ‘remember’ the experience and show signs of fear, such as freezing in place. Then the researchers examined gene activity in neurons in a brain area key to memory — the hippocampus. They found that some genes responsible for inflammation were active in a set of neurons four days after training. Three weeks after training, the same genes were much less active. How to see a memory The team pinpointed the cause of the inflammation: a protein called TLR9, which triggers an immune response to DNA fragments floating around the insides of cells. This inflammatory response is similar to one that immune cells use when they defend against genetic material from invading pathogens, Radulovic says. However, in this case, the nerve cells were responding not to invaders, but to their own DNA, the researchers found. TLR9 was most active in a subset of hippocampal neurons in which DNA breaks resisted repair. In these cells, DNA repair machinery accumulated in an organelle called the centrosome, which is often associated with cell division and differentiation. However, mature neurons don’t divide, Radulovic says, so it is surprising to see centrosomes participating in DNA repair. She wonders whether memories form through a mechanism that is similar to how immune cells become attuned to foreign substances that they encounter. In other words, during damage-and-repair cycles, neurons might encode information about the memory-formation event that triggered the DNA breaks, she says. When the researchers deleted the gene encoding the TLR9 protein from mice, the animals had trouble recalling long-term memories about their training: they froze much less often when placed into the environment where they had previously been shocked than did mice that had the gene intact. These findings suggest that “we are using our own DNA as a signalling system” to “retain information over a long time”, Radulovic says. Fitting in How the team’s findings fit with other discoveries about memory formation is still unclear. For instance, researchers have shown that a subset of hippocampal neurons known as an engram are key to memory formation3. These cells can be thought of as a physical trace of a single memory, and they express certain genes after a learning event. But the group of neurons in which Radulovic and her colleagues observed the memory-related inflammation are mostly different from the engram neurons, the authors say. Flashes of light show how memories are made Tomás Ryan, an engram neuroscientist at Trinity College Dublin, says the study provides “the best evidence so far that DNA repair is important for memory”. But he questions whether the neurons encode something distinct from the engram — instead, he says, the DNA damage and repair could be a consequence of engram creation. “Forming an engram is a high-impact event; you have to do a lot of housekeeping after,” he says. Tsai hopes that future research will address how the double-stranded DNA breaks happen and whether they occur in other brain regions, too. Clara Ortega de San Luis, a neuroscientist who works with Ryan at Trinity College Dublin, says that these results bring much-needed attention to mechanisms of memory formation and persistence inside cells. “We know a lot about connectivity” between neurons “and neural plasticity, but not nearly as much about what happens inside neurons”, she says. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00930-y Read the related News & Views: ‘Innate immunity in neurons makes memories persist’. Updates & Corrections Correction 27 March 2024: An earlier version of this story indicated that broken DNA accumulated in the centrosome. It is DNA repair machinery that accumulates in that organelle. References Jovasevic, V. et al. Nature 628, 145–153 (2024). Article Google Scholar Stott, R. T., Kritsky, O. & Tsai, L.-H.

Because it seems like such a waste of the opportunity afforded by extended physical secueity and direct connection between mother and developing child, that some means of transferring a portion of the mother's learned knowledge, or at least some coarse grained abstraction of it, to the fetus, has never developed. The lazy dismissal of this question is just to say, if nature needed it, it would have evolved it, but this doesn't seem to hold in every case [0]. It seems rather that there was no way for such a capability to be built out of extending existing mechanisms, with the major barrier being the absence of nerve tissue in the umbilical cord, where higher level CNS connectivity might have evolved from as a foothold [0] and certainly doesn't account for what may happen in the future unless nature is completely done developing everything that could be developed.

The inflammatory response and the activities involved in DNA repair seem correlated with long term memory formation. reply rolph 5 hours agoparentprevso far its a correlate, not yet determined to be a direct mechanistic causation reply begueradj 5 hours agoprevThat's something we can use to interpret what is mentioned in \"The Talent Code\" book: https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Code-Greatness-Born-Grown/dp/0... reply cjbgkagh 6 hours agoprevHuh, I wonder if this is why RCCX genes associated with autoimmune conditions / inflammation is also associated with higher IQs. reply lupire 6 hours agoparentThe OP observation is that memory formation includes damaging DNA and repairing it , either as a side effect or as a mechanisms of memory formation, but it's unclear which. Generalized autoimmune disorders probably wouldn't increase memory formation as a mechanism -- that effect would be \"memorizing\" \"white noise\", not a specific meaningful memory (neuron path). But perhaps high IQ individuals, associated with hyperactivity/high metabolism of some kind, have more/faster neuronal activity, cause more of this DNA damage then the average person experiences, to the point where it has detrimental inflammatory effects? reply cjbgkagh 6 hours agorootparentI have multiple TNXB SNPs, tested very high IQ, and have debilitating levels of inflammation with ME/CFS. Wasn’t so bad when I was younger but got really bad in my 20s and 30s. I have it under control now with quite an exotic mix of medications. My memory is pretty insanely good as is my ability to learn new things. I had previously thought it was due to interest and acumen but have come to accept that I am fortunate in ways that others are not - the difference being that I no longer blame others inability to learn as much or as quickly on an apparent laziness or lack of interest. ME/CFS is very debilitating though so most people with this will probably just fade away in their 20s and 30s. There are ways to treat it that I wish more people knew about. Edit; I should mention that too much inflammation is associated with brain fog which inhibits working memory and memory formation. Brain fog is one of the many core symptoms of ME/CFE. It would make sense if the body is optimizing childhood learning over long term health. reply wburglett 5 hours agorootparentWhat approaches are there for treating ME/CFS? reply cjbgkagh 5 hours agorootparentIt depends on the cause but for the TNXB subset which is probably a big chunk of them there is hGH peptides, Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), low dose modafinil, amitriptyline, IGF-agonists (semaglutide/ozempic), low dose naltrexone (LDN), TUDCA, eliminate sugar (including fruit) from diet, melatonin, UV-A light therapy in eyes during the day, blue light blocking glasses at night, sleep hygiene, lower stress lifestyle, supplemental T3 hormone, caffeine, and resistance exercise. Cardio above a fast walk should probably be eliminated due to post exertional malaise (PEM). The cause of PEM is a tough one that I’m still working on. reply wburglett 3 hours agorootparentFor PEM specifically have you had any experience with pyridostigmine or cumin (the kitchen spice)? reply cjbgkagh 2 hours agorootparentI’ve tried Enalapril which seems similar to Pyridostigmine, I ended up with pretty strong blood pressure swings. I’ll check it out though. The problem with testing PEM for me is the extreme downside if the test fails, it could be many months before I’m good again. Instead of trying these things myself I’m more apt to crowd source from people who I know that also have PEM and more open to testing it. reply bugbuddy 6 hours agoprevI am surprised no one has referenced the Animus here. reply Terr_ 5 hours agoparentWhile I see the association, there's no reason to think that DNA from a billions of nerve cells in your brain is somehow being synced to specific single cells.

Being anxious, depressed, afraid, or whatever could be temporarily \"cured\" by shifting you out of the current region in this space. Which chemicals work would depend on your specific programming. This might explain people who have a fear response to positive emotional situations (they were traumatized by someone that otherwise gave them positive emotions that release certain chemicals).

    "originBody": "A121 Open Source AI21 Labs Unveils Jamba: The First Production-Grade Mamba-Based AI Model Jamba is a groundbreaking SSM-Transformer model that offers the best of both worlds, addressing the drawbacks of traditional Transformer architectures while maintaining their powerful capabilities. Chris McKay March 28, 2024 • 2 min read AI21 Labs, has just released Jamba, the world's first production-grade AI model based on the innovative Mamba architecture. Most models today (like GPT, Gemini and Llama) are based on the Transformer architecture. Jamba combines the strengths of both the Mamba Structured State Space model (SSM) and the traditional Transformer architecture, delivering impressive performance and efficiency gains. Jamba boasts an extensive context window of 256K tokens, equivalent to around 210 pages of text, while fitting up to 140K tokens on a single 80GB GPU. This remarkable feat is achieved through its hybrid SSM-Transformer architecture, which leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to draw on just 12B of its available 52B parameters during inference. The result is a model that can handle significantly longer contexts than most of its counterparts, such as Meta's Llama 2 with its 32,000-token context window, while maintaining high throughput and efficiency. Jamba delivers 3x throughput on long contexts, making it a more efficient model than Transformer-based models of comparable size like Mixtral 8x7B. One of the key advantages of Jamba is its ability to deliver 3x throughput on long contexts compared to Transformer-based models of similar size, like Mixtral 8x7B. This is made possible by the model's unique hybrid architecture, which is composed of Transformer, Mamba, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers, optimizing for memory, throughput, and performance simultaneously. It features a blocks-and-layers approach, with each Jamba block containing either an attention or a Mamba layer, followed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This results in an overall ratio of one Transformer layer out of every eight total layers. AI21 Labs says this approach allows the model to maximize quality and throughput on a single GPU, leaving ample memory for common inference workloads. Jamba's impressive performance extends beyond efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The model has already demonstrated remarkable results on various benchmarks, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art models in its size class across a wide range of tasks. Jamba outperforms or matches other state-of-the-art models in its size class on a wide range of benchmarks. Jamba is being released with open weights under Apache 2.0 license. It is available on Hugging Face, and will also be accessible from the NVIDIA API catalog as NVIDIA NIM inference microservice, which enterprise applications developers can deploy with the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. For now, Jamba is currently released as a research model without the necessary safeguards for commercial use. However, AI21 Labs plans to release a fine-tuned, safer version in the coming weeks. As the AI community continues to explore and refine new architectures, we can expect to see even more impressive gains in performance, efficiency, and accessibility, paving the way for a new generation of more capable AI models.",

Good performance for its size and much more efficient than the available open alternatives. The key idea: One of out of every eight transformer blocks in Jamba applies dot-product attention with quadratic cost, but the other seven out of eight apply a Mamba layer with linear cost. And the entire model is a mixture of experts(MoE) so only ~12B parameters are used at once for inference. Thank you to the folks at AI21 for making Jamba available! reply a_wild_dandan 2 hours agoprevTo those curious about the tradeoffs between transformer and state space model layers, I highly recommend Sasha Rush's video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKJEpOtVgXc reply eigenvalue 50 minutes agoprevHas anyone gotten this to work in linux using 1 or 2 4090s? I get stuck on \"Loading checkpoint shards: 71%\" and then it bails. But weirdly nvidia-smi shows plenty of VRAM available. My machine has 256gb of RAM so I don't think that's the problem either. Really excited to try this one. reply Reubend 3 hours agoprevIt's great to see a full production level model using Mamba. But when it comes to long context window benchmarks, I'd love to see performance as well as throughput. I was under the impressions that Mamba has huge increases in throughput at the cost of modest losses in accuracy when using long contexts. reply samus 1 hour agoparentThis one should have you covered :-) one out of every eight layers is a traditional Transformer layer, which should ensure precision, at least over short distances. reply refulgentis 2 hours agoparentprevI would too -- long context has been such a red herring across providers, Claude 3 is the first I've seen that seems to genuinely have some sort of qualitative leap in noticing things. It is worth noting I'm fairly sure there's no inherent theoratical decrease to accuracy in long contexts, the claimed theoratical change is an _increase_ in long-term accuracy in long contexts. reply tempusalaria 1 hour agorootparentEvery long context sucks right now. All the model providers benchmark on fact recall which is very limited. Actual ability to do anything complicated beyond 16k tokens is not present in any current model I have seen. reply binalpatel 1 hour agorootparentprevGemini 1.5 Pro is really good at long context in my experience. reply Arthur_ODC 1 hour agorootparentprevLong Context is great and all, but it sucks that all of these LLM's have really poor output length.

DNNs unlock semantics (parsing, transforming, producing). That's the basis of general intelligence, not encyclopedic random string recall. Models shouldn't burn ungodly quantities of compute emulating DDR5 with their working memory. We need machines that think better, not memorize well. We already have plenty of those. Massive context windows, and their needle tests, are misguided. We won't reach human-level AGI by basically inventing a natural language RDBMS.

Per usual in engineering, there are big trade offs! reply kelseyfrog 12 minutes agorootparentI'm not following. State is a multi-dimensional vector and context is a list of tokens. State is perturbed by A and Bx(t), while context is appended to by sampling the predicted token distribution. reply refulgentis 2 hours agoparentprevI'm not sure I follow fully, it is also the case for (handwaves) \"traditional\" LLMs that state + input = next state + output. Its just that output increases, so as output becomes input, eventually state + input / next state + output is greater than the context size. Re: linear scaling, that means the runtime cost is O(n) to context size, rather than traditional transformer O(n^2) reply maccam912 1 hour agorootparentI think kelseyfrog meant that the state for a mamba model is supposed to \"remember\" stuff even if it doesn't have the actual tokens to reference any more. It might not be guaranteed to hang on to some information about tokens from a long time ago, but at least in theory it's possible, whereas tokens from before a context window in a tradional llms may as well never have existed. reply kelseyfrog 1 hour agorootparentYes, you said it better than I did :) reply visarga 1 hour agorootparentprevThat is valid for Mamba, this model (Jamba) is a mix of transformer and mamba layers, so it still has a quadratic memory cost, but divided by 8. reply google234123 1 hour agoprevI’m pretty sure computational chemists were combining NNs with Kalman Filters for a while now… I recall the issue it was slow due to the N^2 size of the covariance matrix reply uoaei 1 hour agoparentSurprised they hadn't found ways to advance their techniques with e.g. low-rank approximations, etc. reply htrp 3 hours agoprevcompute still has cost? reply samus 1 hour agoparentIn not sure I understood your question.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/shizunge/endlessh-go",
    "originBody": "endlessh-go A golang implementation of endlessh exporting Prometheus metrics, visualized by a Grafana dashboard. Introduction Endlessh is a great idea that not only blocks the brute force SSH attacks, but also wastes attackers time as a kind of counter-attack. Besides trapping the attackers, I also want to visualize the Geolocations and other statistics of the sources of attacks. Unfortunately the wonderful original C implementation of endlessh only provides text based log, but I do not like the solution that writes extra scripts to parse the log outputs, then exports the results to a dashboard, because it would introduce extra layers in my current setup and it would depend on the format of the text log file rather than some structured data. Thus I create this golang implementation of endlessh to export Prometheus metrics and a Grafana dashboard to visualize them. If you want a dashboard of sources of attacks and do not mind the endlessh server, besides trapping the attackers, does extra things including: translating IP to Geohash, exporting Prometheus metrics, and using more memory (about 10MB), this is the solution for you. Getting Started Clone the repo then build from source: go build . ./endlessh-go & Alternatively, you can use the docker image: docker run -d -p 2222:2222 shizunge/endlessh-go -logtostderr -v=1 It listens to port 2222 by default. Then you can try to connect to the endlessh server. Your SSH client should hang there. ssh -p 2222 localhost If you want log like the C implementation, you need to set both CLI arguments -logtostderr and -v=1, then the log will go to stderr. You can set different log destinations via CLI arguments. Also check out examples for the setup of the full stack. Usage ./endlessh-go --help Usage of ./endlessh-go -alsologtostderr log to standard error as well as files -conn_type string Connection type. Possible values are tcp, tcp4, tcp6 (default \"tcp\") -enable_prometheus Enable prometheus -geoip_supplier string Supplier to obtain Geohash of IPs. Possible values are \"off\", \"ip-api\", \"max-mind-db\" (default \"off\") -host string SSH listening address (default \"0.0.0.0\") -interval_ms int Message millisecond delay (default 1000) -line_length int Maximum banner line length (default 32) -log_backtrace_at value when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace -log_dir string If non-empty, write log files in this directory -log_link string If non-empty, add symbolic links in this directory to the log files -logbuflevel int Buffer log messages logged at this level or lower (-1 means don't buffer; 0 means buffer INFO only; ...). Has limited applicability on non-prod platforms. -logtostderr log to standard error instead of files -max_clients int Maximum number of clients (default 4096) -max_mind_db string Path to the MaxMind DB file. -port value SSH listening port. You may provide multiple -port flags to listen to multiple ports. (default \"2222\") -prometheus_clean_unseen_seconds int Remove series if the IP is not seen for the given time. Set to 0 to disable. (default 0) -prometheus_entry string Entry point for prometheus (default \"metrics\") -prometheus_host string The address for prometheus (default \"0.0.0.0\") -prometheus_port string The port for prometheus (default \"2112\") -stderrthreshold value logs at or above this threshold go to stderr (default 2) -v value log level for V logs -vmodule value comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging Metrics Endlessh-go exports the following Prometheus metrics. Metric Type Description endlessh_client_open_count_total count Total number of clients that tried to connect to this host. endlessh_client_closed_count_total count Total number of clients that stopped connecting to this host. endlessh_sent_bytes_total count Total bytes sent to clients that tried to connect to this host. endlessh_trapped_time_seconds_total count Total seconds clients spent on endlessh. endlessh_client_open_count count Number of connections of clients. Labels: ip: Remote IP of the client local_port: Local port the program listens to country: Country of the IP location: Country, Region, and City geohash: Geohash of the location endlessh_client_trapped_time_seconds count Seconds a client spends on endlessh. Labels: ip: Remote IP of the client local_port: Local port the program listens to The metrics is off by default, you can turn it via the CLI argument -enable_prometheus. It listens to port 2112 and entry point is /metrics by default. The port and entry point can be changed via CLI arguments. The endlessh-go server stores the geohash of attackers as a label on endlessh_client_open_count, which is also off by default. You can turn it on via the CLI argument -geoip_supplier. The endlessh-go uses service from ip-api, which may enforce a query rate and limit commercial use. Visit their website for their terms and policies. You could also use an offline GeoIP database from MaxMind by setting -geoip_supplier to max-mind-db and -max_mind_db to the path of the database file. Dashboard The dashboard requires Grafana 8.2. You can import the dashboard from Grafana.com using ID 15156 The dashboard visualizes data for the selected time range. The IP addresses are clickable and link you to the ARIN database.

I'd assume a large proportion of these bots still can't run concurrently. reply Svip 11 hours agoprevThe original endlessh hints at this, but doesn't go further into details, and the endlessh-go's README doesn't mention it at all. Am I suppose to have endlessh run on port 22 and then have my real SSH server run on an obscure port? In none of the examples does it run on port 22. I feel like I'm missing something obvious, that the READMEs simply take for granted I know. reply dylan604 6 hours agoparentIsn't the point of a honeypot that it's not a real server? What guarantees are there that there won't be an exploit that allows escaping the honeypot into the real data? Personally, I do not believe anything is 100% secure. So inviting the vampire into your facade home, and then getting upset when the vampire sees the charade and walks into your real home is just one of those \"well of course that happened\" situations. reply rolph 2 hours agorootparentif you use port knocking, the first hit on your honeypot, can be the trigger to lockdown or redirect, a lot of other ports to somewhere away from your actual. reply ycombinatorrio 6 hours agoparentprevI run endlessh on the port 2222 and I configured fail2ban to redirect the source ip addresses who did X failed attempts from the dest port 22 to the dest port 2222 transparently. I use the table NAT and prerouting to achieve that, you can use ipset to match the source ip addresses. reply withinboredom 4 hours agorootparentI do something similar except send them bytes from /dev/random, providing free protocol fuzzing. reply pdimitar 4 hours agorootparentprevOh nice, do you have a blog post detailing it step by step? reply agilob 11 hours agoparentprevYes, check this distro https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/endlessh reply nilsherzig 11 hours agoparentprevThat's how I have it setup reply nubinetwork 9 hours agoparentprevI don't think it matters, ssh bots will try any port that sends back the ssh banner. reply michaelcampbell 8 hours agorootparentThat's the theory. I have an internet facing box using ssh on a weird port with fail2ban on it just in case. In over 10 years I've never had a single probe on that port with ssh. reply AlecSchueler 7 hours agorootparentSame, I went from logging thousands of attempts per day to zero per decade with a simple switch of ports. reply skrause 9 hours agorootparentprevBut they don't scan every port. I've been running my SSH server on a non-standard port for a long time, it took four years until I had the first bot with login attempts. About a year ago I changed the port and haven't seen any bots since then. reply qwertox 8 hours agorootparentYou can surround your custom port by a couple of ports on which a simple server listens for connection attempts. Any connection attempt is considered hostile and the ip will then be blacklisted in iptables. This prevents portscans from reaching your port. reply metadat 8 hours agorootparentOnly works for sequential scans, most scanners are more targeted towards specific services. reply AlecSchueler 7 hours agorootparentIf they're targetting SSH specifically how are they going to guess i'm running it on port 1690 and not port 22 other than by scanning up in sequence? reply kevindamm 6 hours agorootparentDifferent quality of locks in the ever-escalating arms race. Probably there are many many more sequential scanners out there. For the persistent actors who are doing random ordering or shuffle then you could add port-knocking for the real sshd... but then they just have to find a working client and sniff the connection requests... to which you add a TOTP step for determining which ports to use, and so on... reply dambi0 5 hours agorootparentprevThere is a known upper bound they could randomise the guesses from the range. reply yard2010 4 hours agorootparentprevExcuse the old school metaphor - you put a lock on your door so your house is harder to break into, not to prevent anyone from breaking into your house. reply metadat 1 hour agorootparentAbsolutely agree, when I wrote this I was thinking more of defending against the low hanging fruit - mass scanners. Once someone has deemed you a worthwhile target and is carefully proving all ports, these more nuanced approaches become more worthwhile. Even then, a sophisticated adversary may have many unique src IPs at their disposal. reply freedomben 9 hours agorootparentprevThe more targeted/sophisticated ones will, but there's a crapload of bots that just scan all publicly addressable IPs for port 22 and attempt to connect. If your goal is to trap as many bots as possible in the tarpit, you'll get a lot more if you run on port 22. reply michaelcampbell 2 hours agorootparentprevThey CAN, but they don't. reply hwbunny 1 hour agoprevBut why? Just hide your ssh port. And port knock in. Or put it @ tor/wg/whatever. reply ok123456 7 hours agoprevFollowing the SSH hardening guide stops 99% of bots and scanners because they can't negotiate a cipher using whatever ancient ones their SSH implementation is set up to use. reply LinuxBender 5 hours agoparentThis, and a handful of simple firewall rules in the raw table can block about 90%+ of that remaining 1% just looking at the spoofable banner that none of the bots seem to spoof I assume due to being lazy like me.

Instead I get the bot operators to block me by leaving SSH on port 22 and then giving them a really long VersionAdendum that seems to get the bots feeling broken, sticky and confused. There are far fewer SSH bot operators than it appears. They will still show up in the logs but that can be filtered out using drop patterns in rsyslog. VersionAddendum \" just put in a really long sentence in sshd_config that is at least 320 characters or more\" Try it out on a test box that you have console access to just in case your client is old enough to choke on it. Optionally use offensive words for the bots that log things to public websites. Only do this on your hobby nodes, not corporate owned nodes unless legal is cool with it, in writing. reply Snawoot 4 hours agorootparentWhy use PREROUTING chain? You could have achieved same with INPUT chain without specification of ingress interface and server IP address. reply LinuxBender 4 hours agorootparentAnything I explicitly drop I do so in the raw table to keep them out of the state table. The state table is more CPU expensive especially at high packet rates and runs the risk of depleting the default state table limits especially for anything that now has a broken state on purpose like these poor lil bots. Since I brought it up, here is how to increase the state table limits. Create /etc/modprobe.d/nf_conntrack.conf cat /etc/modprobe.d/nf_conntrack.conf options nf_conntrack expect_hashsize=256400 hashsize=256400 And then in /etc/sysctl.conf: # from /etc/sysctl.conf: increase state table limits. # Requires 1/4 mem to hash table plus 400 overhead because I am the cargo culting king: # cat /etc/modprobe.d/nf_conntrack.conf # options nf_conntrack expect_hashsize=256400 hashsize=256400 net.nf_conntrack_max = 1024000 Should people use default state table memory allocations on a busy node, everyone can be locked out of it regardless of how many TB of RAM are free. The node can appear \"down\". reply myself248 3 hours agorootparentprevinclude EICAR.TXT ;) reply daghamm 9 hours agoprevBut the bots can easily detect these, cant they? As long as there is a timeout on socket read, this shouldn't waste that much of the scanners time. Or am I misunderstanding this? reply LysPJ 6 hours agoparentEndlessh periodically sends data so the read timeout won't trigger. Specifically, it draws out the crypto negotiation stage indefinitely by exploiting a feature of the SSH protocol. (Of course, the bot author could detect that behaviour too.) There's more info from the author of Endlessh: https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/03/22/ reply gnfargbl 6 hours agoparentprevYou're understanding perfectly. The way this works is that it sends a slow drip of junk before the SSH version banner string. A scanner running at any real scale is going to have an overall timeout beyond which it doesn't bother waiting any longer for the banner string. This is going to very slightly irritate some of the extremely low-level actors. Is setting up a tool to do that a good use of time? If you want to effectively deter attackers using a sand-trap approach, you need to find some kind of task with asymmetric cost in your favour. This isn't that. reply eddd-ddde 3 hours agorootparentWhat is a good example of assymetrical cost in your favour? reply arsome 9 minutes agorootparentYou could probably achieve better here by providing fake weak credentials and then getting an actual human to connect and check out the honeypot on as many IPs as possible. reply gnfargbl 2 hours agorootparentprevCAPTCHAs are an example. Although I am not sure if they're a good example. reply c0wb0yc0d3r 7 hours agoparentprevYes a bot can, and sophisticated bots do. At the same time it's much easier to write code that just died the bare minimum. Imagine you're a bot herder, if your bot net consists of stolen CPU cycles what difference does it make if your bots are slowed down. It doesn't cost you money. reply throw10920 6 hours agorootparent> if your bot net consists of stolen CPU cycles what difference does it make if your bots are slowed down. It doesn't cost you money. This is wrong. It does cost you money - either directly, because you paid money to use someone else's botnet, or as an opportunity cost, in that you can't use your bots on as many targets. reply INTPenis 3 hours agoprevFunny but my first thought wasn't wasting their time at all, that's easily fixed with a few code adjustments on their client end. My thought was to harvest their IPs and publish them in blocklists. reply rijoja 1 hour agoparent> My thought was to harvest their IPs and publish them in blocklists. Please do, it would mean good karma. reply sandos 7 hours agoprevI think you could employ the same tactics that advanced fuzzers do with these tarpits: then mutate the responses randomly, to try get \"new\" responses from the attackers, instead of new coverage in the code as in the fuzzer. Unless they are using static scripts, which would be boring. I have understood that most attacks are super-simple sort of, so probably not much to learn there. But an interesting project! reply lez 2 hours agoprevFor other usecases there is an ipfilter target TARPIT, that does a similar thing on the TCP level. reply schlonger0009 11 hours agoprevDoes it matter, though? You can easily scan out the correct SSH port. reply dugite-code 11 hours agoparentDepends on how well programed the bot is I guess. Personaly I use the encrypted packet port knocking package fwknop on my home server to hide the ssh port until I need it. reply bayindirh 8 hours agoparentprevYou can setup a VPN (or head/tailscale) and confine your \"real\" sshd there, and leave one of these tarpits in the open for fun and profit. reply nilsherzig 11 hours agoparentprevScanning all 65k ports takes time. Those aren't targeted attacks, just bots connecting to every 22 ports they can find reply scsh 11 hours agoparentprevThe point of this isn't to hide your actual SSH service, but to tie up resources for those who are somewhat blindly scanning/connecting to any open SSH port. reply nilsherzig 11 hours agoparentprevScanning all 65k ports takes time. Those aren't targeted attacks, just bots connecting to every 22 ports they can find reply HumblyTossed 8 hours agoprev [–] > Unfortunately the wonderful original C implementation of endlessh only provides text based log, but I do not like the solution that writes extra scripts to parse the log outputs, then exports the results to a dashboard, because it would introduce extra layers in my current setup and it would depend on the format of the text log file rather than some structured data. Thus I create this golang implementation of endlessh to export Prometheus metrics and a Grafana dashboard to visualize them. \" I didn't like the logging, so I re-implemented the entire thing.\" I'm not mocking, I just see this often (and have done it myself!).
