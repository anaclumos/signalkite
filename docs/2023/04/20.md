### Building telescopes on the Moon could transform astronomy

#### [News](https://theconversation.com/building-telescopes-on-the-moon-could-transform-astronomy-and-its-becoming-an-achievable-goal-203308)

- Building telescopes on the Moon could transform astronomy
- Lunar exploration is undergoing a renaissance with many missions planned, including NASA's Artemis program which aims to return humans to the lunar surface by the middle of the decade
- The Moon offers advantages for observational astronomy with its stable surface and craters that receive no sunlight
- The far side of the Moon is particularly attractive for radio astronomy as it is permanently shielded from radio signals generated by humans on Earth, making it probably the most "radio-quiet" location in the whole solar system
- The lunar far side is also an ideal location for low-frequency radio astronomy, which can probe the structure of the early universe
- The Moon's low gravity also enables the construction of much larger telescopes than is feasible for free-flying satellites
- The cold, stable environment of permanently shadowed craters may also have advantages for instruments to detect gravitational waves and for studying solar wind and galactic cosmic rays
- However, there is a tension between human activities on the lunar far side and unwanted radio interference, and plans to extract water-ice from shadowed craters might make it difficult for those same craters to be used for astronomy.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35633490)

- Building telescopes on the moon could revolutionize astronomy by providing higher sensitivity and spectrographic resolution.
- High cost of building telescopes is justified in the hopes of making groundbreaking scientific discoveries, inspiring future generations, and driving technical innovation.
- Scientific discovery's value cannot be quantified by $/unit and shares a high-cost, high-reward approach with fields like particle physics.
- Military spending has historically driven scientific advancements.
- Tangible benefits of funding scientific research include providing a framework for how technology operates, benefiting society through discoveries from unexpected research, and cultivating a highly-trained workforce.
- Proposed telescope FOCAL could potentially provide otherwise impossible scientific measurements and is more important than settling on Mars.
- NASA's Artemis program aims to build a radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which has a radio-quiet environment and could produce higher-quality images than any observatory on Earth regarding the Big Bang's cosmic radiation.
- Location of the telescope on the Moon overcomes one of the biggest difficulties of space-based telescopes because the lunar rock shields against most sources of high-frequency noise from satellites, man-made or natural.
- Technical complications related to the Moon's environment, such as fine dust covering the hardware, thermal control, and communication problems with Earth, need to be solved by space engineers.
- Communication with Mars could improve by using modern storage technology, Venus satellites, or a halo orbit at earth-moon L2, L4, or L5, but the moon is difficult to orbit due to the unevenness of gravity.
- The actual existence and detection of "dark" matter and energy remains elusive, and using planets or asteroids for a gravity lensing effect is impractical due to the large focal point.
- Discovery of mascons led to the study of their effect on spacecraft, and the discovery of "frozen orbits."
- Telescope on the Moon presents more access and less risk for maintenance than telescopes like JWST that are too far for Hubble to observe it.
- The comment section debates the likelihood and cost of a proposed lunar telescope project and the tendency to search for water in celestial bodies.
