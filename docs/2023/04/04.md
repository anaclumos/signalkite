### Saying Goodbye to GitHub

A software developer reflects on leaving GitHub over its handling of AI training on code and Copilot monetization, spurring debates on open source enforcement, ethics, compensation, legal reform, and OSS licenses. GitHub's ToS must protect users' IP rights when uploading code, and Copilot mainly uses agreed-upon user code. The situation highlights prevalent copyright issues, especially with transformative use for machines. The generated code by a model falls under GPL, and writing something else later isn't considered copying, nor does it require opening source code.

### OutSail (YC W23) – Wingsails to reduce cargo ship fuel consumption

OutSail Shipping is creating sails for cargo ships that reduce fuel consumption by up to 20%, with no interference to cargo operations, while Wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP) devices can improve a ship's Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) rating without reducing speed or changing the route. Outsail designs a shipping container that converts into a detachable wind power unit for use on ocean-going vessels, which can save up to 30% of fuel costs, and that can be furled and unfurled with ease in rough seas. A Y Combinator startup called B9 Shipping is developing a cargo ship fitted with wings capable of harnessing wind power to increase the vessel's efficiency. Boundless Ocean Sailing Technologies has developed "smart sails" that use sensors and algorithms, allowing ships to detect wind speed and strength and adjust sails accordingly. OutSail is developing a containerized, retractable sail system for cargo ships to reduce emissions, that utilizes tape-spring rollers, and retrofitting is expected to be required to install the system onto existing fleets; They plan to install autonomous sails on container ships, with sails that don't require permanent changes to the ship, and do not require a mast, and further testing is ongoing.

### Alibaba breaks itself up in six

Alibaba splits into six independent business units, each able to raise capital separately via IPOs, with e-commerce remaining the largest unit. The move spurs a 14% share price surge and may pre-empt regulators' intervention or signal confidence in the end of the tech crackdown. The article and comments discuss CCP's control over all branches of government and possible reasons for Jack Ma's disappearance. Meanwhile, there are debates about China's government and future tech policies, as recent moves may give investors hope but risk careful vetting. The discussion also touches on monopolistic behavior in the tech industry, both in the US and China, and potential benefits and drawbacks of breaking up big tech companies. Ultimately, the CCP's decision to break up Alibaba may be aimed at enforcing its power to maintain control over rival power bases.

### Pandas 2.0

The Pandas team has released version 2.0.0, with new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements; existing code should be upgraded to Pandas 1.5.3 first. While Polars is faster, Pandas remains valuable for analysts and engineers working on evolving models; Sklearn offers casting of Polars and DuckDB to Pandas with seamless interoperability. Pandas' 2.0 release introduces general support for arrow-specific dtypes; automatic casting and strings as objects and integers turning into floats when NaNs are introduced remain significant frustrations for some users. Pandas offers quality of life improvements, and Copy-on-Write is explicitly enabled. Pandas drew inspiration from R's base data frame but was influenced by plyr and data.table. Python programmers have a new open-source library to use instead of expensive Stata, even for fields such as pharma.

### Safari releases are development hell

Safari 16.4 has caused issues for Construct, breaking all published content, due to problems with the Compression Streams API and Service Workers. Apple's lack of transparency and delay updates in their release process has led to frustrations among developers. Furthermore, Safari adds support for OffscreenCanvas, which causes pre-existing web content to break, as it only supports 2D context. Developers are increasingly looking towards Chrome and Firefox as alternatives. Meanwhile, Chrome's temporary origin trial and implementation of hardware APIs led to objections from Safari and Firefox developers. Apple's lack of transparency regarding bugs and future products, as well as its app store guidelines, have also been criticized. Developing for Safari's buggy and inconsistent performance can be challenging, requiring workarounds and sacrificing compatibility with other browsers. Users may switch to another browser if their workflows do not work on Safari or if multiple sites break at the same time.

### Giving kids no autonomy at all has become a parenting norm

Constant attendance to children in the US has led to helicopter parenting, fueling anxiety and depression in parents and limiting children's autonomy, causing anxiety and depression in parents. This culture of intensive parenting has been accelerated by the pandemic, and misguided reporting to the police creates divisions and increases the need to defund police in non-emergency situations. The fear of risk has led to a rise in nosy culture and individualism, but trust-building and communication are essential for online safety. Some countries have lower crime rates and trust in society, allowing people to leave their belongings without fear of theft, but expectations for children's responsibility have declined, and different safety concerns and reasons can make certain practices not work in the US.

### Near-lossless image formats using ultra-fast LZ codecs

Richard Geldreich presents the idea of simple ultra-high-speed lossy or near-lossless image codecs, built from new generation fast LZ codecs that minimize visible artifacts by introducing more or longer matches. Lossless framebuffer compression is important for MSAA and SSAA. Computing power increases slower than high-speed bandwidth, and images codecs like PNG do not work well with multi-threading or GPU decoding. Preprocessing images can improve compression with fast LZ codecs without requiring a reversal step. Zstd, which combines fast decoding and high compression, could be an alt to lz4 preprocessing. CO2 emissions caused by gaming downloads versus physical media is still under debate. Improvement ideas include progressive JPEGs and wavelets, but they may come at the cost of compression rates and memory efficiency.

### State-of-the-art open-source chatbot, Vicuna-13B, just released model weights

The recently released model weights for the open-source chatbot, Vicuna-13B, comply with the LLaMA model license as delta weights. Limited model releases could become more restricted in the future due to DMCA takedown requests on llama-dl arguing that NN weights aren't copyrightable. Researchers unaffiliated with Facebook are allowed to possess and use the original Vicuna-13B model weights. The model, which contains a set of tweaks, requires around 60 GB of CPU RAM but can also run on a CPU-only mode with 64GB RAM. The model's massive search operations save time and energy, leading to better results. The accuracy of 4-bit quantized models is less than the original model. The weights of ML models represent what the model has "learned" and are essential to its proper functioning.
