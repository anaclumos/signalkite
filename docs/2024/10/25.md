## [Smartphone buyers meh on AI, care more about battery life](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/with-apple-intelligence-on-the-horizon-a-quarter-of-smartphone-owners-are-unimpressed-by-ai/)

- A CNET survey indicates that many smartphone users are unimpressed by AI features from major companies, especially if they require a subscription fee.
- Key statistics show that 25% of users don't find AI helpful, 45% are unwilling to pay for AI, and 34% have privacy concerns.
- The primary reasons for upgrading phones are longer battery life, more storage, and better cameras, with only 18% motivated by AI features.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41946188)

- Smartphone consumers prioritize practical features such as battery life and camera quality over AI capabilities, which are often seen as unhelpful or not worth additional costs.
- There is a demand for smaller phones with high-end specifications, although these models typically do not perform well in sales.
- The trend indicates a preference for tangible improvements in smartphone technology rather than AI-driven features perceived as gimmicks.

## [The brain's waste clearing lymphatic system shown in people for first time](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/brain-waste-clearance-system-shown-people-first-time)

- A recent study confirmed the existence of the glymphatic system in humans, which is responsible for clearing brain waste and may influence Alzheimer's disease.
- The study utilized MRI scans during brain surgery to observe cerebrospinal fluid flow through specific channels, supporting efforts to enhance the glymphatic system.
- Enhancing the glymphatic system could potentially improve sleep quality and reduce the risk of dementia, with updates available through NIH Research Matters.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41942096)

- The brain's waste-clearing lymphatic system, known as the glymphatic system, has been observed in humans for the first time, marking a significant scientific discovery.
- Independent research suggests that certain visual patterns might induce glymphatic clearance while awake, potentially benefiting individuals with diseases that impair this process, such as Long Covid and ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome).
- The concept that visual stimuli can trigger waste clearance in the brain is intriguing, though the exact effects and mechanisms are still under investigation.

## [Why Safety Profiles Failed](https://www.circle-lang.org/draft-profiles.html)

- Safety Profiles, introduced in 2015 to enhance memory safety in C++ code, failed due to incorrect assumptions about the sufficiency of existing code information for ensuring safety.- Unlike Rust, which uses lifetime parameters and borrow checking, C++ lacks necessary aliasing, lifetime, and safeness information, making compile-time memory safety unachievable.- The failure of Safety Profiles highlights the need for C++ to adopt explicit aliasing, lifetime, and safeness properties, potentially integrating Rust's safety model to improve security and interoperability.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41939967)

- C++ faces challenges with memory safety due to its use of iterators, which can lead to aliasing issues, whereas the D language uses arrays with defined lengths to mitigate these problems.
- Safety profiles in C++ are debated as potentially being more of a distraction than a solution, as they do not fully ensure memory safety, unlike Safe C++ which aims for complete memory safety by default.
- The complexity of C++ makes implementing safety difficult without major changes, and while Rust offers a safer alternative, transitioning existing C++ codebases remains a significant challenge.
