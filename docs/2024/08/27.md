## [Why has Japan been hit with rice shortages despite normal crops?](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20240823/p2a/00m/0bu/024000c)

- Japan is facing rice shortages and rising prices despite normal crop yields due to a long-standing acreage reduction policy aimed at controlling market prices.
- This policy, in place for over 50 years, incentivizes farmers to switch to other crops, leading to tightly managed rice production and vulnerability to demand fluctuations.
- Experts suggest abolishing the policy, increasing rice production, and boosting exports to enhance food security and benefit consumers.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41366304)

- Japan is experiencing rice shortages despite normal crop yields due to government policies incentivizing farmers to reduce production to maintain high prices.
- This 60-year-old policy limits supply, causing even minor demand increases, such as from tourism, to result in shortages and higher prices.
- Critics suggest that Japan should abandon this policy to increase production, potentially becoming a major rice exporter and improving food security.
