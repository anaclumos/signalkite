- This development is particularly exciting for applications requiring high pixel density, such as VR headsets, but it may not yet be suitable for general-purpose displays due to its current limitations.

## [Closed form arc length parametrization is impossible for quadratic Bézier curves](https://ninjakoa.la/curly_curves/posts/quadratic_bezier_arc_length_parametrization/)

- Bézier curves are fundamental in vector graphics, defined using control points in the Bernstein basis.
- Quadratic Bézier curves use three control points, and their arc length can be computed exactly, but the parametrization lacks a closed form solution, assuming Schanuel's conjecture.
- Cubic Bézier curves use four control points, and their arc length must be computed numerically as it lacks a closed form.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40991075)

- Closed form arc length parametrization is not feasible for quadratic Bézier curves; numerical solutions are preferred for their stability and accuracy.
- Although closed form solutions can be faster, they tend to become unstable, particularly for curves near a straight line.
- Numerical methods are generally superior and more practical for most applications, despite the existence of Pythagorean-Hodograph curves and Euler spirals.
