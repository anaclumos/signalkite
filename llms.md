## Directory Structure
- `app/` (Next.js App Router)
  - Subfolders for each route, each containing `page.tsx` and optionally `layout.tsx`.
- `components/ui/` (UI Primitives)
  - Reusable React components (Buttons, Dialogs, Inputs).
  - Minimal logic; rely on Tailwind for styling.
  - We are using Tremor (NOT shadcn)
- `data/` (Seed Data & Demo Content)
  - JSON, CSV, or seed scripts for database initialization.
- `lib/` (Custom Hooks & Utilities)
  - Utility functions (e.g., data fetching, mobile detection).
- `prisma/` (Database Schema & Client)
  - Contains `schema.prisma` and Prisma client initialization.
- `public/` (Static Assets)
  - Images, icons, and brand files.
- `next.config.ts`
  - Next.js configuration (e.g., experimental features, prerendering).
## Data Modeling (Prisma)
- Define models in `prisma/schema/*.prisma` (Separated from `schema.prisma`).
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` for database updates.
- Use `npx prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client.
- Fetch and update data using Prisma in server components.
## Next.js 13+ App Router & React 19
- File-Based Routing
  - Each `app/` subfolder with `page.tsx` defines a route.
- Layouts
  - Use `layout.tsx` to wrap child routes.
- Server Components
  - Default in `app/` directory; import data directly.
- Client Components
  - Add `"use client"` for client-side interactions.
- Metadata
  - Export a `metadata` object in pages and layouts for SEO.
- Partial Prerendering
  - Enable in `next.config.ts` to improve load performance.
- Server Actions
  - Use `"use server"` to handle form submissions in server components.
## Tailwind CSS & Theming
- Setup
  - Install Tailwind and configure `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Dark Mode
  - Use `darkMode: "class"` in Tailwind config.
  - Implement `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes`.
- Utility Classes
  - Use Tailwind for consistent styling (spacing, typography, colors).
## UI Components & Patterns
- `components/ui/` Directory
  - Small, composable UI blocks (Buttons, Inputs, Dialogs).
- Minimal Logic
  - Typed with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind.
- Tremor UI
  - Similar to shadcn, focusing on composability. We are NOT using shadcn.
## Clerk Authentication & Middleware
- Usage
  - Wrap app in `<ClerkProvider>`.
  - Use `<SignIn>`, `<UserButton>`, `<SignedIn>`.
## Scheduling, Subscriptions & Strategies
- Scheduling
  - Store cron expressions in the `Schedule` model.
  - Implement background jobs for execution.
- Subscriptions
  - Define `Subscription` model linking `User` and `Reporter`.
  - Trigger notifications on new stories.
- Strategies
  - Each `Reporter` has a strategy field (e.g., `"HN_BEST_STORIES"`).
  - Implement fetching logic accordingly.
## Testing, Linting & Automation
- Vitest
  - Install and create `.spec.ts` tests.
- Playwright
  - Install and create `.test.ts` tests.
- Biome (Lint & Format)
  - Use `biome check .` and `biome format .`.
- GitHub Actions
  - Automate CI with linting, tests, and builds.
## Implementation Tips
- Keep server logic in server components or actions.
- Use client components only for interactive UI.
- Maintain consistent TypeScript types across codebase.
- Store secrets in environment variables (`.env`).
- Always create tests for new features.
## Tests
- Always add e2e tests and Vitest spec tests at the end. e2e tests are located in the e2e folder, and the Vitest spec test should be colocated with .test.ts
- after the file name.
## Commit Messages
- When everything is done, print what should be a commit message as conventional commit.
  - type(scope): description
  - type must be one of [build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test]
- You should use the ASCII representation of the emoji, not the Unicode itself. For example, :sparkles: is correct, not âœ¨.

## Special Gotchas

- Use "import { cx } from "@/lib/utils" to combine tailwind classes.
- Use authInterrupts, such as unauthorized() and forbidden() instead of return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 }) or return new Response("Forbidden", { status: 403 })
- Always read Prisma schema files before writing code, inside `prisma/schema/*.prisma`
