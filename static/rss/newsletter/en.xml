<ul>
<li>The Witcher 3 has successfully run on a RISC-V PC, marking the first AAA game to do so, thanks to advancements in Box64, Wine, and DXVK.</li>
<li>Significant progress has been made in the RISC-V backend, including fixing RV64 DynaRec bugs and adding new x86 instructions, facilitated by new hardware like the Milk-V Pioneer and VisionFive 2.</li>
<li>Despite challenges such as the lack of 16-byte atomic instructions and lower translation efficiency compared to other architectures, The Witcher 3 runs at up to 15 fps in-game on RISC-V.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41364549">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Box64 is an emulator enabling x86-64 applications to run on non-x86-64 architectures, such as RISC-V, by using native system libraries for better performance.</li>
<li>Running The Witcher 3 on RISC-V involves translating x86-64 instructions to RISC-V, which is challenging due to differences in instruction sets and the need for efficient GPU translation.</li>
<li>RISC-V&#39;s open and flexible nature, despite lacking some features like SIMD optimizations, makes it a promising alternative to proprietary architectures like x86-64 and ARM, with ongoing efforts to enhance its performance and compatibility.</li>

<ul>
<li>Zuckerberg admitted regret for succumbing to White House pressure on content moderation, highlighting a significant issue in platform governance.</li>
<li>Users criticized Facebook&#39;s news feed for excessive AI-generated content and clickbait, preferring the older version, with similar complaints about Twitter.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about the increase in political and inappropriate content on Facebook, leading some users to abandon the platform, and the broader issue of social media prioritizing engagement over user experience was discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://transactional.blog/blog/2024-erasure-coding">Erasure Coding for Distributed Systems</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Erasure coding enhances storage efficiency and fault tolerance by splitting data into chunks and adding parity chunks, allowing data reconstruction even if some chunks are lost.</li>
<li>Key applications include storage systems (reducing costs and increasing durability) and quorum systems (improving read performance with some write limitations).</li>
<li>Popular libraries for implementing erasure codes are Jerasure and Intel ISA-L, with adaptive schemes like HRaft adjusting based on available replicas.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41361281">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussion centers around erasure coding, a method for data protection in distributed systems, highlighting its use in various technologies like Ceph and RaptorQ.</li>
<li>Erasure coding is praised for its efficiency in data recovery and fault tolerance, but it also has complexities and limitations, such as inelasticity in updating coding parameters and computational intensity.</li>
<li>The conversation includes references to specific implementations and algorithms, such as Luby Transform Code, RaptorQ, and Wirehair, and touches on potential patent issues and practical applications in real-world systems.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/2u-edx-bankruptcy/">The Triple Failure of 2U, EdX, and Axim</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, 2U acquired edX for $800 million, leading to financial strain and eventual bankruptcy by 2024.</li>
<li>The acquisition added $42 million in annual interest expenses, and efforts to reduce costs and unify operations under the edX brand failed.</li>
<li>Axim Collaborative, the non-profit holding the $800 million from the sale, has shown minimal impact on the edtech space, becoming primarily a grant-giving organization.</li>

<h2><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/08/25/telegram-is-not-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/">Is Telegram really an encrypted messaging app?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov was recently arrested by French authorities for insufficient content moderation, highlighting concerns about the platform&#39;s security practices.</li>
<li>Telegram is often labeled as an “encrypted messaging app,” but it does not offer default end-to-end encryption, requiring users to manually activate “Secret Chats” for private conversations, which is not available for group chats.</li>
<li>Despite its growth, Telegram has not improved its encryption usability, and its marketing as a secure messenger is misleading, posing risks to users who believe their conversations are private.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41350530">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussion questions whether Telegram is truly an encrypted messaging app, focusing on its end-to-end encryption (E2EE) capabilities.</li>
<li>The &quot;mud puddle test&quot; is mentioned, suggesting that if you can recover old messages on a new device, law enforcement might also access them, indicating potential security flaws.</li>
<li>Telegram&#39;s privacy policies and its ability to comply with law enforcement requests are debated, with some arguing it is a trust-based app rather than a cryptographically secure one.</li>

<ul>
<li>In August 2024, the developer of Geddit, a non-commercial, open-source Reddit client, was permanently banned from Reddit.</li>
<li>The issue began in June 2023 when Reddit introduced new API pricing, charging $12,000 per 50 million requests, which threatened non-commercial apps like Geddit.</li>
<li>Despite Geddit&#39;s popularity, with over 25k downloads, Reddit misunderstood its non-commercial nature, leading to the developer pausing the project and receiving no further communication from Reddit.</li>

<ul>
<li>BMW surpassed Tesla in European electric vehicle (EV) sales for the first time in July 2024, but this is a misleading headline as Tesla remains ahead year-to-date (YTD).</li>
<li>The increase in BMW registrations was marginal, with only about 300 more cars registered in July, and this occurred during a period when Tesla had fewer cars available for sale due to their production and shipping schedule.</li>
<li>The metric used, car registrations, may not perfectly reflect actual sales, as it can be influenced by various factors such as dealer inventory and timing of consumer purchases.</li>

<h2><a href="https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html">How the OCaml type checker works (2022)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Didier Rémy&#39;s 1988 algorithm for type generalization in OCaml enhances type inference speed by avoiding inefficient environment scans, using levels to track type dependencies.</li>
<li>Rémy&#39;s method, akin to generational garbage collection, ensures type variables are only quantified when their defining region is inactive, preventing unsound generalization.</li>
<li>OCaml&#39;s type checker implements this algorithm, using levels to manage type variables and enforce scope discipline, significantly improving type inference efficiency.</li>
