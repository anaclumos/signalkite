<h2><a href="https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/why-is-chile-so-long">Why is Chile so long?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Chile&#39;s unique length is due to the Andes mountains, creating a narrow strip of land between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean.</li>
<li>The country&#39;s geography is shaped by the collision of the Nazca and South American tectonic plates, forming the Andes.</li>
<li>Chile&#39;s borders were historically contested, notably in the War of the Pacific, where it gained resource-rich territories.</li>

<li>Venezuela has become the first Andean country to lose all its glaciers, with the Humboldt Glacier in the Sierra Nevada now too small to be classified as a glacier.</li>
<li>The International Climate and Cryosphere Initiative (ICCI) confirmed this status, noting that Venezuela had six glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, but only the Humboldt Glacier remained by 2011.</li>
<li>Scientists attribute the glacier&#39;s disappearance to climate change and rising global temperatures, with a 2023 study predicting that 83% of the world&#39;s glaciers could disappear by 2100 if temperatures continue to rise.</li>

<h2><a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/a-brief-introduction-to-interval-arithmetic/">A brief introduction to interval arithmetic</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Interval arithmetic addresses measurement inaccuracies by representing values as ranges, providing bounds for the correct number rather than a single imprecise floating point value.</li>
<li>While interval arithmetic can offer more accurate results, it can also lead to overly large boundaries, making it less practical, as noted by William Kahan, the creator of the IEEE-754 standard.</li>
<li>John Gustafson&#39;s universal numbers are a recent development in this field, though it&#39;s uncertain if his posit version incorporates intervals; his rivalry with Kahan adds an interesting dynamic to the discussion.</li>

<li>Interval arithmetic is used in a graphing calculator to handle formulas without solving for y, by rearranging equations and calculating result intervals for x and y ranges.</li>
<li>The method involves recursively dividing ranges and performing binary searches to find tiny intervals with solutions, which are then drawn as points on the graph.</li>
<li>This approach is highlighted for its application in various fields, including index analysis in databases like ClickHouse, and its potential for rigorous numerical computations.</li>

<li>Traditional tools like sudo and doas use setuid binaries and privilege escalation, which have limitations in restricted user namespaces and require the entire user session to retain capabilities.</li>
<li>An alternative approach using s6-sudod splits the program into a privileged server and an unprivileged client, aiming to run commands as root without privilege escalation.</li>
<li>The author experimented with using local SSH for root command execution, configuring a dedicated SSH key, binding sshd to a Unix domain socket, and using ProxyUseFdpass to handle socket file descriptors, enhancing security and supporting various authentication methods.</li>

<li>Using SSH as a sudo replacement introduces complexity by requiring root binaries to communicate via UNIX sockets and asymmetric cryptography.</li>
<li>Restricting sudo access to the wheel group and ensuring only authorized users can read or execute it can provide similar security with less complexity.</li>
<li>Tools like etckeeper, Ansible, and Chezmoi can help manage and track configuration changes effectively, offering alternatives to traditional sudo usage.</li>

<h2><a href="https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/">Never* Use Datagrams</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>When building internet applications, TCP is preferred for reliable delivery, while UDP is used for timeliness, especially in live video protocols.</li>
<li>Using UDP directly is risky due to the need for implementing features like retransmissions and congestion control; instead, developers should use a QUIC library.</li>
<li>QUIC and Media over QUIC (MoQ) support datagrams, but developers are advised to focus on using QUIC streams to avoid pitfalls associated with datagrams.</li>

<h2><a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/">Start all of your commands with a comma</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Unix users often create a ~/bin/ directory in their home directory to store custom scripts, but this can lead to name collisions with system commands.</li>
<li>To avoid these collisions, the author suggests prefixing custom command names with a comma, which is treated as a normal character in filenames and avoids conflicts.</li>
<li>This technique, combined with tab-completion, allows for easy browsing of custom commands and has proven to be a robust solution for over a decade.</li>
