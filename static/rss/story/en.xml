<li>A study by Duke University researchers connects glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, to significant levels of chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka&#39;s rural communities.</li>
<li>The study suggests that glyphosate can form complexes with certain trace metals in hard water, enabling it to remain for extended periods. Moreover, higher levels of harmful fluoride and vanadium were found in the communities&#39; drinking water.</li>
<li>These findings indicate a potential serious health risk from glyphosate and accentuate the need for close scrutiny on the potential implications of other contaminants.</li>

<li>The paper presents MemGPT, a system designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) by providing extended context within their constrained context window.</li>
<li>Inspired by hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems, MemGPT uses virtual context management for enhanced performance.</li>
<li>The system, evaluated in domains like document analysis and multi-session chat, showed superior capabilities beyond current LLMs&#39; limitations. The MemGPT code and data are now available for public experimentation.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Internet Service Provider (ISP), Grande Communications, is contesting a $47 million piracy damage lawsuit owed to record labels, arguing ISPs should not bear responsibility for copyright infringements based on third-party claims.</li>
<li>Grande invokes a recent Supreme Court decision favoring Twitter, asserting that terminating internet access due to copyright claims is overly broad, impacts innocent users, and restricts broadband infrastructure investment.</li>
<li>Several telecom industry groups backing Grande also reference the Supreme Court ruling, suggesting that charging Grande with piracy liability could have been a mistake.</li>

<li>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has endorsed the application of sound waves, a technique known as histotripsy, to destruct liver tumors in human bodies.</li>
<li>Developed by the University of Michigan and implemented by HistoSonics, this innovation employs ultrasound waves to generate microbubbles in tumors, leading to their fragmentation and elimination by the immune system.</li>
<li>Histotripsy not only provides a noninvasive alternative to traditional cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but also shows potential benefits for the immune system and future integration with immunotherapy or drug delivery.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The European Commission&#39;s proposed regulation to combat child sexual abuse could be susceptible to function creep, in which the client-side scanning system may detect non-CSAM (child sexual abuse material) content.</li>
<li>There&#39;re potential risks that entities with access could adulterate the CSAM database with non-relevant data, affecting communication and raising privacy issues.</li>
<li>Success of this proposed system hinges on the abuse centers&#39; capacity to spot and manage false positives and malicious entries; hence, the design and handling of reports in the client-side scanning system are critical.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Dutch parliament held a hearing on the EU&#39;s &quot;Chatcontrol&quot; proposal which pertains to client-side scanning; a debated technology that scans private messages, potentially leading to unwarranted investigations.</li>
<li>Despite parliamentary opposition through two motions, the Dutch government has decided to disregard them, thus maintaining the pursuit for said technology.</li>
<li>Concerns raised at the hearing were about not only the intrusion into private conversations but also the unproven effectiveness of the technology, with an additional warning against possible cooperation with China in this field.</li>

<li>Atlassian, a software company, has announced its acquisition of video messaging platform Loom for approximately $975 million, which will strengthen its team collaboration tools and enable video integration into workflows.</li>
<li>Loom, with over 25 million global users, will be incorporated into Atlassian software like Jira and Confluence, with the acquisition expected to close by March 2024.</li>
<li>Although funded with existing cash balances, Atlassian predicts that the acquisition will cause dilution in their operating margins for fiscal years ending in June 2024 and 2025.</li>

<li>A vulnerability has been found in the HTTP/2 protocol that could be used to launch a denial-of-service attack on NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus, and related products, affecting the NGINX HTTP/2 module.</li>
<li>The vulnerability lets an attacker rapidly cancel numerous HTTP/2 streams, thereby overloading the server without triggering its configured threshold.</li>
<li>NGINX has issued a patch to tackle this vulnerability, improving system stability by imposing a limit on the number of new streams within one event loop. They advise users to update to the newest packages and tweak configuration files for added protection. Limiting connections and requests from single clients is also advised. Cloudflare, Amazon, and Google assisted in mitigating this vulnerability.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In August, Google confirmed that an unprecedented DDoS attack, using the HTTP/2 protocol, targeted its services and Cloud customers, with one attack reaching 398 million requests per second.</li>
<li>Google&#39;s global load balancing infrastructure successfully prevented any service outages by mitigating the attack on the edge of its network.</li>
<li>Google has since implemented additional protective measures and worked with industry partners to address this new attack vector throughout the ecosystem. The article further elaborates on the attack methodology and provides mitigation strategies.</li>

<li>The assertion that medieval staircases were primarily clockwise for defense purposes is a myth with no supporting evidence from medieval sources.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article offers a detailed tutorial on creating pyramid salt crystals at home with table salt, illustrating the author&#39;s findings that adding alum to the salt solution yielded a purer salt taste.</li>
<li>Variables like temperature, humidity, and impurities were found to influence the size and shape of the crystals, while magnesium sulfate may potentially affect crystal size.</li>
<li>Although the experiments partially reflected a previously published study, the author documented these findings and promised more guides on crystal growth for subscribers.</li>

<li>The article clarifies that Linux utilises unused memory for disk caching, which may falsely indicate low memory but doesn&#39;t hamper running applications.</li>
<li>The disk caching enhances system performance and doesn&#39;t steal memory from applications, debunking misconceptions about memory usage.</li>
<li>The piece advises against disabling disk caching given its benefits to applications while offering ways to accurately assess available memory and identify low memory symptoms.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A recent study by Google DeepMind and the University of Illinois challenged the current understanding of self-correction in large language models (LLMs), revealing they often struggle to refine their answers without external feedback.</li>
<li>The study suggests self-correction in LLMs is more effective when they can utilize external sources like human feedback or a knowledge base; without such, their performance significantly drops.</li>
<li>The research also stresses the significance of well-designed initial prompts for LLMs and the cautious application of self-correction to enhance their accuracy and reliability, especially in tasks like altering the LLM&#39;s stylistic output or ensuring safer responses.</li>
