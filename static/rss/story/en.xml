            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>OpenAI, a prominent AI company, plans to purchase $51 million worth of brain-inspired chips, called neuromorphic processing units (NPUs), from Rain, a startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</li>
<li>The deal brings attention to potential conflicts of interest arising from Altman&#39;s personal investments and his role as OpenAI CEO.</li>
<li>OpenAI&#39;s investment in AI chips reflects its commitment to advancing AI technology.</li>
<li>Rain&#39;s chips, based on the RISC-V open-source architecture, offer the potential for increased computing power and energy efficiency compared to current graphics chips used in AI development.</li>
<li>Rain has faced challenges, including the removal of a Saudi Arabia-affiliated investor due to national security concerns.</li>
<li>Rain has claimed to be in advanced talks with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for chip systems.</li>
<li>The funding round for Rain was scrutinized by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), highlighting concerns about critical technology access and control.</li>
<li>OpenAI may need to find partners with significant financial backing to meet its hardware needs.</li>

<li>Singing to babies is an important factor in helping them learn language, according to a study from the University of Cambridge.</li>
<li>The research indicates that infants initially understand language through rhythm and tone, rather than individual sounds.</li>
<li>The study challenges the belief that processing phonetic information is the primary aspect of language learning and suggests that dyslexia and developmental language disorder may be linked to rhythm perception.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Scientists have found that fiber optic cables can pick up the sound of cicadas, leading to a potential new method for monitoring insect populations.</li>
<li>Using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), researchers can analyze the light bouncing back from a laser fired through the cables to detect disturbances caused by loud sounds or seismic activity.</li>
<li>This technique could allow entomologists to remotely monitor cicadas and collect data on their population sizes and locations, using the already abundant fiber optic cables. However, monitoring quieter insect species with DAS may be more challenging.</li>

<li>The BitBucket web UI has a glitchy animation that causes high CPU and GPU usage during builds.</li>
<li>The animation, which rotates a static SVG image, is poorly optimized and affects system performance.</li>
<li>Removing the animation resolves the problem, but the layout of the whole page is recomputed on each frame, leading to additional performance issues.</li>

<li>Mozilla&#39;s innovation group and Justine Tunney have created llamafile, a new method for running Large Language Models (LLMs) on your own computer.</li>
<li>A llamafile is a multi-GB file that contains both the model weights for an LLM and the required code to run the model.</li>
<li>Users can execute the llamafile using Cosmopolitan Libc, which compiles a single binary that works on multiple operating systems and hardware architectures.</li>
<li>By running the llamafile executable, users can start a web server and interact with the model in their browser, enabling local usage of LLMs without an internet connection.</li>

<li>The authors propose a method for generating multi-view optical illusions using pretrained diffusion models.</li>
<li>The method supports various transformations such as rotations, flips, color inversions, skews, jigsaw rearrangements, and random permutations.</li>
<li>The method involves aligning and averaging noise estimates from different views or transformations of an image to take a diffusion step.</li>
<li>The authors discuss the conditions that views must meet for the method to work, including linearity and statistical consistency.</li>
<li>Use of orthogonal transformations, particularly permutation matrices, can generate interpretable and visually meaningful optical illusions.</li>
<li>The paper provides examples and references related works in the field.</li>

<li>The avocado industry aims to delay ripening, while home cooks usually want to speed up the process.</li>
<li>Ripening can be accelerated by storing avocados in a brown paper bag with a banana, which produces ethylene gas.</li>
<li>Microwaving avocados is not recommended as it cooks rather than ripens them, and ripe avocados can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days.</li>
<li>To prevent browning, plastic wrap is not very effective, but submerging avocado pieces in water or using plastic wrap directly on mashed avocado can help delay oxidation.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author discovered a new feedback loop technique using DALLE-3 and GPT4-Vision, inspired by Translation Party.</li>
<li>By generating an image with DALLE-3 based on a text prompt, converting it back to a text prompt with GPT4-Vision, and repeating the process, fascinating and unexpected outcomes can be achieved.</li>
<li>To try this technique, users must have their own OpenAI API key, and the author provides some favorite examples of this process.</li>

<li>Scientists at the University of Chicago have discovered that a fatty acid called trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) found in beef, lamb, and dairy products can enhance the ability of immune cells to fight tumors.</li>
<li>Higher levels of TVA in the blood were associated with improved response to immunotherapy in cancer patients.</li>
<li>This research suggests that TVA could be used as a nutritional supplement to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments, and there may be other nutrients from plants that activate immune cells in a similar way.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A recent study conducted with hunter-gatherer societies suggests that infants and toddlers benefit from high levels of personal attention and care from multiple caregivers.</li>
<li>Hunter-gatherer infants receive approximately nine hours per day of attentive care and physical contact from up to 15 different caregivers.</li>
<li>The study argues that Western countries should prioritize affordable high-quality childcare support that goes beyond mere supervision and emphasizes the well-being of both mothers and children. Additionally, involving older children and adolescents in caregiving can be beneficial.</li>
<li>The research proposes that stable sets of core caregivers within larger networks play a crucial role in children&#39;s emotional and cognitive development.</li>
<li>The authors emphasize the importance of collaboration among society, policymakers, employers, and healthcare services in providing the necessary support and care for mothers and children to thrive.</li>

<li>The author presents a methodology for studying cheating in online chess tournaments and disproves claims of widespread cheating.</li>
<li>They use a difference-in-difference analysis to compare rates of cheating in online and offline tournaments and propose Elo ratings as a metric for cheating.</li>
<li>Data from Titled Tuesday games on Chess.com shows no evidence of cheating, and the report also compares the accuracy of Chess.com and FIDE ratings, concluding that allegations of widespread cheating in online chess are baseless.</li>
