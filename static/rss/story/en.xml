            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The NHS is conducting an investigation into whether Palantir violated its contract by executing a covert influencer campaign without authorization.</li>
<li>Palantir employed PR and marketing agencies to reach out to social media influencers and offered them compensation for promoting their contract to operate the Federated Data Platform, using the NHS name and brand without consent.</li>
<li>Palantir argues that the campaign was an &quot;exploratory project&quot; and did not necessitate consultation with the NHS, while the Good Law Project criticizes Palantir&#39;s actions and advocates for safeguarding the national interest.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article explores the role of the cerebellum in controlling movement and its significance in motor skills.</li>
<li>It highlights the unique features of the cerebellum, such as Purkinje cells, and how they contribute to enhancing cognition.</li>
<li>The study challenges traditional notions of learning by demonstrating that learning can occur within individual cells in the cerebellum.</li>
<li>Dysmetria, difficulty in accurately estimating distance and speed, is a common symptom of cerebellar damage.</li>
<li>Patients with cerebellar damage also struggle with tasks requiring attention switching.</li>
<li>The cerebellum is involved in anticipation, prediction, and generating a predictive model of the world.</li>
<li>It plays a crucial role in generating quick predictions for action and is connected to various parts of the cerebrum involved in cognitive processes.</li>
<li>Damage to the cerebellum can result in clumsy and disproportionate actions.</li>
<li>The concept of embodied cognition, where cognitive functions are closely linked to sensorimotor functions, is supported.</li>
<li>The article concludes by mentioning the perspectives of dysmetria of thought and the universal cerebellar transform theories in relation to embodied cognition.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A chemistry lab in CNRS-Université Sorbonne Paris Nord has been found to have multiple scientific articles with manipulated and recycled data.</li>
<li>Instead of retracting the articles, CNRS requested corrections and imposed a one-month exclusion from duties on the responsible scientist.</li>
<li>The authors argue for prompt investigation of research misconduct, transparent reporting of results, immediate retractions of articles with serious errors, and the return of research funding used for fraudulent research. They emphasize the negative consequences of failing to address misconduct effectively, such as hindering scientific progress, eroding public trust, and enabling dishonest scientists to compete with honest ones. Institutions protecting researchers involved in misconduct are criticized.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Global Fishing Watch has conducted research using AI and satellite imagery to create the first global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure, revealing previously unknown industrial activity in the ocean.</li>
<li>The study discovered that 75% of the world&#39;s industrial fishing vessels are not visible to the public.</li>
<li>&quot;Dark fleets&quot; were identified operating in marine protected areas, and there is a high concentration of vessels in Asian waters compared to Europe.</li>
<li>The research indicates a decline in fishing activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, while offshore energy development, particularly wind turbines, increased.</li>
<li>This technology has the potential to contribute to addressing climate change and improve marine management and transparency efforts.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Rosebud AI is a platform that enables non-technical creators to develop games by generating the code for them based on their game descriptions.</li>
<li>It supports browser-based, JavaScript frameworks and emphasizes AI non-player characters (NPCs) that use LLMs (large language models) for dialogue and actions.</li>
<li>The platform&#39;s unique approach to game creation and its use of generative AI sets it apart from other game engines, and it operates on a business model similar to Roblox, allowing developers to charge users and taking a cut of the revenue. It has garnered positive feedback from beta testers.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Passing structs larger than 16 bytes on AMD64 can significantly slow down code execution.</li>
<li>Changing arrays to be passed as three separate pointer parameters instead of one struct parameter improved the performance of the Neat language by a factor of two.</li>
<li>This improvement is due to the fact that structs larger than 16 bytes are passed by pointer in the SystemV AMD64 ABI specification, resulting in extra stack rearrangement for function calls. By passing arrays as separate pointer parameters, the values are already in SSE registers and do not need to be loaded from the stack, resulting in faster execution.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Perfectionism and procrastination are often linked because perfectionists have a fear of making mistakes and being criticized, causing them to delay tasks.</li>
<li>However, not all perfectionists procrastinate, as some are motivated to submit work on time in order to meet high standards.</li>
<li>The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination depends on factors like the type of perfectionism and self-efficacy. Anxiety, fear of failure, and depression can also contribute to procrastination, which may be associated with perfectionism.</li>
<li>To address perfectionistic procrastination, individuals can set realistic goals, focus on themselves, address their fears, consider the negative impact of perfectionism, and develop self-efficacy and self-compassion.</li>
<li>Various anti-procrastination techniques, such as breaking tasks into smaller steps and scheduling work according to productivity cycles, can also be effective in overcoming procrastination.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Bun is a new JavaScript runtime that is known for its speed and is built on JavaScriptCore, unlike Node and Deno which are built on V8.</li>
<li>JavaScriptCore has a niche optimization feature called Tail Call Optimization (TCO), which allows for recursion without exceeding the call stack.</li>
<li>While TCO can be implemented in Bun by rewriting functions and moving state to arguments, the TCO solution in Bun is slower than the original for loop solution. However, using mutation can achieve similar performance in a recursive solution.</li>
<li>TCO enables programmers to express complex and efficient programs without relying on imperative loops.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author proposes using indents instead of a parent-child structure to display tree-like lists in a user interface (UI).</li>
<li>They argue that the visual appearance of the tree is often more important than the actual relationship between items.</li>
<li>The author provides examples and pseudocode to help implement this technique, but also advises that it may not be suitable for all scenarios and suggests alternative methods for situations requiring a true tree structure.</li>

<li>The append-only b+tree is a data structure commonly used for efficient storage and retrieval of data.</li>
<li>It is made up of branch and leaf pages, with the leaf pages containing the actual data and keys.</li>
<li>Rather than supporting leaf chaining for sequential access, each update involves appending a new page to the file and updating the parent pages, ensuring a consistent snapshot of the database without the need for a transaction log. This approach is more efficient for writing consecutive pages to disk, but may waste disk space.</li>
