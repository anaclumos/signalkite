<li>After the removal of CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI employees considered accepting a blanket offer from Microsoft, but most were not genuinely interested in working for Microsoft and saw it as a last resort.</li>
<li>Many employees felt pressured to sign an open letter demanding Altman&#39;s reinstatement and the resignation of the OpenAI board, driven by a clash of cultures, lack of respect for Microsoft&#39;s talent bar, and disbelief in compensation promises.</li>
<li>Money was also a motivating factor, as millions of dollars in equity were at risk if OpenAI were to collapse. However, Altman has been reinstated, and the planned tender offer for equity is proceeding, valuing OpenAI at over $80 billion. Microsoft employees were upset with the promise to match salaries for OpenAI employees, considering Microsoft&#39;s previous layoffs and salary cuts.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Genetic testing company 23andMe is changing its Terms of Service (TOS) to include binding arbitration for dispute resolution instead of focusing on strengthening its security measures.</li>
<li>This update means that users would have to bring their cases to a neutral third-party arbitrator, whose decision would be final and legally binding.</li>
<li>Users have a 30-day period to opt out of these new terms, but the change has drawn criticism as it reduces users&#39; rights and protections in the event of a security breach.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Mozilla Firefox browser may face a decline in support from U.S. government websites due to its low market share.</li>
<li>The U.S. Web Design System only supports browsers with over 2% usage, and currently, Firefox has a 2.2% share.</li>
<li>The rise of Chrome and Safari on mobile devices is contributing to the decline of Firefox&#39;s usage.</li>
<li>If Firefox falls below the 2% threshold, it may no longer be supported by government websites, potentially leading to a domino effect with corporations discontinuing support as well.</li>
<li>The author expresses concern about the future relevance of Firefox if its decline continues.</li>

<li>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing surveillance and spying, allowing for the tracking of activities and the understanding of conversations at an unprecedented scale.</li>
<li>AI-powered systems can now summarize meetings and organize millions of conversations, enabling mass spying where all data is saved, searchable, and comprehensible in large quantities.</li>
<li>Mass spying can reveal intricate details about individuals, including their relationships, alliances, and conversations, and is fueled by ubiquitous microphones like Siri and Alexa.</li>
<li>Governments, corporations, and tech monopolies are already engaging in mass surveillance, and mass spying will worsen personalized advertising and erode privacy.</li>
<li>Limiting mass spying would require robust data privacy regulations, although little has been done thus far to address mass surveillance.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Scientists have found that fiber optic cables can pick up the sound of cicadas, leading to a potential new method for monitoring insect populations.</li>
<li>Using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), researchers can analyze the light bouncing back from a laser fired through the cables to detect disturbances caused by loud sounds or seismic activity.</li>
<li>This technique could allow entomologists to remotely monitor cicadas and collect data on their population sizes and locations, using the already abundant fiber optic cables. However, monitoring quieter insect species with DAS may be more challenging.</li>

<li>The method supports various transformations such as rotations, flips, color inversions, skews, jigsaw rearrangements, and random permutations.</li>
<li>The method involves aligning and averaging noise estimates from different views or transformations of an image to take a diffusion step.</li>
<li>The authors discuss the conditions that views must meet for the method to work, including linearity and statistical consistency.</li>
<li>Use of orthogonal transformations, particularly permutation matrices, can generate interpretable and visually meaningful optical illusions.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The avocado industry aims to delay ripening, while home cooks usually want to speed up the process.</li>
<li>Ripening can be accelerated by storing avocados in a brown paper bag with a banana, which produces ethylene gas.</li>
<li>Microwaving avocados is not recommended as it cooks rather than ripens them, and ripe avocados can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days.</li>
<li>To prevent browning, plastic wrap is not very effective, but submerging avocado pieces in water or using plastic wrap directly on mashed avocado can help delay oxidation.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In 2003, during the assembly and testing phase of NASA&#39;s Spirit Mars Rover, a surge of electricity destroyed the motors of the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) attached to the rover&#39;s robotic arm, resulting in a $500 million loss.</li>
<li>The incident emphasizes the significance of learning from failures and the importance of support from colleagues, as the connection was eventually restored and testing continued.</li>
<li>The author, Chris Lewicki, now encourages others to share their own failure stories to foster collective wisdom and promote innovation in the space industry.</li>
