### The LLama Effect: Leak Sparked a Series of Open Source Alternatives to ChatGPT

[Original](https://thesequence.substack.com/p/the-llama-effect-how-an-accidental).
The accidental leak of "Llama," an LLM model, has sparked an open-source alternative movement to models like GPT-4 and Cohere that are only available via APIs. Since the leak, Alpaca, Vicuna, Koala, ColossalChat, and ChatLLama, among other models, have been released, all built on top of Llama. The open-source alternatives to these models have not shown the same performance level until the Llama release. The leak of Llama has turned out to be one of the biggest sparks of innovation in the open-source LLM space, where a war between open-source and API-based distribution is looming. The LLama effect has proven that open source is a viable distribution mechanism for foundational models, and there are some interesting sources of innovation in the LLM space.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35504428).
'The LLama Effect' leak has sparked open-source alternatives to ChatGPT, gaining attention from tech experts. GPT-4 demonstrates more significant intelligence, offering reasoning and generalizing abilities from its predecessor, GPT-3. AI text-only models grasp spatial reasoning and can understand puzzles, but manual fine-tuning is necessary. There is debate around language models' actual level of learning happening, with the hope of an accessible and democratized AI future. LLaMA leak has led to open-source optimization on all platforms; however, experts criticize software piracy and AI companies' regulation. OpenAI may face legal challenges for using models to train commercial outcomes. ChatGPT accuracy is divergent, with some considering it useless, while others claim GPT-4 improves in some aspects. Bing/Sydney and ChatGPT have different personalities. The post does not provide new technology facts but discusses the nature of text compression.

### EY gets banned from new audit business in Germany

[Original](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/04/05/ey-gets-banned-from-new-audit-business-in-germany).
EY has been banned for two years from auditing new publicly-listed clients in Germany as APAS, Germany's accounting watchdog, issued a €500,000 fine along with the harshest penalty ever. The decision, which comes after a three-year investigation into EY's role in the Wirecard scandal, has inflicted a significant financial and reputational blow to the beleaguered accounting giant. EY had given wirecard a clean bill of health until the company collapsed in 2020 amid allegations of massive financial fraud. Post-Wirecard scandal, EY has allegedly up-to $2bn over three years to improve audits concerning technology and fraud detections, but no auditor is likely to get things right every time.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35501937).
Ernst & Young (EY) has been banned from conducting new audits in Germany due to incorrect auditing decisions and involvement in the Wirecard scandal. Consulting firms subcontract lower-paid staff to minimize risk, but this can backfire. Auditors only provide reasonable assurance and do not guarantee fraud won't occur. Use of automation and AI can help detect fraudulent activity. Auditing should be separated from consulting to prevent conflicts of interest. There is debate over the value of consulting firms and the need for "skin in the game."

### Sunset at the South Pole

[Original](https://brr.fyi/posts/sunset).
At the South Pole Station, the sun rotates in a near-perfect counterclockwise circle around the sky, making no difference between "night" and "day". As a result, the sunset is spread out over several weeks, and the temperature drops rapidly when the sun is low in the sky, usually around mid-February. The post includes photographs of sunset views from various directions as well as a video to demonstrate the strange phenomenon. The station also observes "daylight savings time," even though there is no visible difference between times on a given day. The post details that South Pole Station follows New Zealand time and provides other data such as twilight stages and the first star sighting of the season.

### PL/Rust 1.0: now a trusted language for Postgres

[Original](https://tcdi.github.io/plrust/plrust.html).
PL/Rust is a loadable procedural language that allows writing PostgreSQL functions in Rust, providing access to Postgres' Server Programming Interface and safe Rust types over most of Postgres-built-in data types; PL/Rust functions are compiled to native machine code rather than being interpreted, providing the best performance. PL/Rust is now a trusted procedural language for Postgres on x86_64 and aarch64 systems if proper compilation requirements are met, allowing PL/Rust to live in a universe of Safe Rust; PL/Rust uses its own rustc driver to apply custom lints to a user's LANGUAGE plrust function to apply certain code idioms that they know not to have "I-Unsound" issues. By default, PL/Rust will not perform cross compilation, but it must be installed and enabled through configuration.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35501065).
PL/Rust 1.0 now trusted in Postgres as an alternative for database functions. Cloud providers RDS and Supabase enable PL/Rust implementation. Has exceptional performance but still vulnerable to issues. Event triggers and DO blocks haven't been incorporated yet. Rust has access to dev ecosystem, efficient types and better performance. May limit optimization for computational triggers.

### Z-Library to let users share physical books

[Original](https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-plans-to-let-users-share-physical-books-through-z-points-230408/).
Z-Library, the largest repository of pirated books, is expanding its services to include a physical book-sharing market, with millions of users able to pick up paperbacks at dedicated "Z-Points" around the world. It plans to organise "collection and storage points" for books that "will be the link between those who share their books and those who need them," which will require considerable storage space and organisational effort, so fulfillment centres and third-party logistics services are welcome. An announcement posted in the site appears to be serious, with people suggesting Vietnam, Brazil, Portugal, Colombia, Iran, Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Spain, India, Argentina, Egypt, France, Ethiopia, China and Ghana as ideal Z-Point locations, and the site is currently welcoming feedback to improve its service.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35499065).
Z-Library will allow users to share physical books, but publishers may sue the library; some suggest scanning books, changing copyright laws, or incentivizing book scanning. Some debate the feasibility and impact on publishing companies of launching a real-world book sharing market. E-book licensing models have unfortunate consequences, leading to piracy as a form of protest. Private membership libraries predate public libraries and often loaned.

### The first game 'Easter eggs' were an act of corporate rebellion

[Original](https://thehustle.co/the-first-easter-eggs-were-an-act-of-corporate-rebellion/).
The first Easter eggs in video games were a result of designers being denied credit for their work, leading to hidden messages in games. The first Easter egg was found in Atari's 1980 game "Adventure", created by Warren Robinett. The tradition of hidden messages continued in the 1970s arcade games to seek recognition and individuality. Robinett's Easter egg elevated his status, and he went on to develop a successful software business. The Tech Times reports on various cookies used by companies for tracking users' online behavior and personalizing ads, but they have not been classified yet.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35503260).
A Hacker News post about corporate rebellion through Easter eggs features anecdotes and current corporate policies. Readers' interest may pique due to the historical relevance and evolution of the Easter egg's role. Current Easter eggs express corporate pride, not insubordination. Code reviews prevent Easter eggs. Former tech companies often fall under newly appointed MBAs. Warren Robinett is praised for Adventure game. U2's member and Atari fan have different names.

### Modular Errors in Rust

[Original](https://sabrinajewson.org/blog/errors).
The article discusses the importance of modular error handling and introduces the principle of error types being near their unit of fallibility, using a hypothetical Rust library as an example. Issues with unhelpful error messages, inextensibility, and difficulty matching errors are outlined, and solutions such as the .source() method and better error type construction are suggested. The example library's error type is split into three distinct types with good backtraces and precise error matching, and I/O errors are explained through a more structured error type design. The article emphasizes the significance of good backtraces, extensibility, inspectability, stability, and modularity in error handling, and suggests that good error handling is worth learning.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35502874).
Rust's error messages are popular but varied error types are needed. SNAFU allows for producing unique traces. Distinct errors reduce proliferation and make handling easier but beware of supporting public APIs. Logging and terminating should not be the primary approach for debugging libraries. Granular or opaque errors with descriptions are preferred. Checked exceptions in Java are praised. The fatal flaw of Java is not having algebraic types.

### 68–95–99.7 Rule

[Original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule).
The 68-95-99.7 rule is a statistical approximation estimating the percentage of values within a standard deviation from the mean in normal distribution. The rule states that roughly 68%, 95% and 99.7% fall within one, two, and three standard deviations respectively. This rule has multiple uses in different fields, such as quality control and data analysis. It is a quick way to obtain a rough probability estimate for a population assumed to be normal. The formula can be applied to different distributions, and it can help identify outliers in data analysis.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35501780).
Discussion Service comments discuss limitations of the 68-95-99.7 rule in analyzing data. Nassim Nicholas Taleb's work & Chebyshev's Inequality are mentioned. Tangents on financial trading & history of US options market. Expert users claim high IQ scores are unreliable & scale is arbitrary.

### The Ruling That Threatens the Future of Libraries

[Original](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/internet-archive-libraries-federal-court-ruling/673615/).
A federal court ruling that controlled digital lending (CDL) violates copyright law could have disastrous implications for libraries, including having to choose between purchasing expensive ebook licenses from publishers or expanding their collections; the Internet Archive (IA), a nonprofit organisation that loans out digital copies of the millions of books it has collected and digitised, has been at the centre of a lawsuit by several book publishers who sued it in 2020 alleging copyright infringement; and it was this CDL loaning model the court ruled against last month, which could have "unfair power over the future of books and libraries alike," according to attorney Corynne McSherry of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is representing the IA in its appeal over the ruling.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35502238).
A court ruling on controlled digital lending and copyright laws has sparked debates, with suggestions to shorten copyright length to prevent loss of knowledge; some suggest publishers' profits should not be the issue in lending CDL material. Libraries have adapted to become public entertainment centers, and public access to resources is critical; librarians use expert opinion to balance circulation popularity, book value, and library's mission when discarding books. Publisher lawsuits against Internet Archive's unlimited royalty-free digital distribution compromise writers' earnings, and controlled digital lending could endanger copyright laws' protection. The intersection of digital and physical ownership remains a topic of debate; discussions offer unique perspectives on the issue at hand.

### Do Kwon converted illicit funds from LUNA to Bitcoin

[Original](https://cointelegraph.com/news/do-kwon-converted-stolen-funds-from-luna-to-bitcoin-s-korean-prosecutors).
South Korean prosecutors have identified nearly $314.2 million worth of illicit assets linked to Terraform Labs' co-founder, Do Kwon, and his associates, of which Kwon alone is connected to about $69 million. Prosecutors have contacted Binance to halt any withdrawal request associated with Kwon. Kwon reportedly converted most of the illicit funds, which number around 414.5 billion won, into Bitcoin, and none of the assets related to him are recoverable or under the jurisdiction of South Korean authorities. Terra was a crypto ecosystem that collapsed in May 2022, in which former CEO Kwon was accused of siphoning off Bitcoin worth nearly $100 million post-collapse.

[Discussion Service](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35499996).
On-chain data shows Terraform Labs' Do Kwon's Bitcoin conversion of fraudulent LUNA funds. Exposes limitations of tracking fraud through traditional banks. Discussion Service users discuss privacy tools and honesty in the crypto space. Debate whether intelligence evolved for competition or cooperation, with some arguing for the latter.

### Supavisor – a Postgres connection pooler written in Elixir

[Original](https://github.com/supabase/supavisor).
Supavisor is a Postgres connection pooler that can proxy millions of Postgres end-client connections into a stateful pool of native Postgres database connections via a scalable, cloud-native architecture. This system simplifies Postgres cluster management for database managers by providing easy configuration of highly available Postgres clusters, while being resource-efficient, scalable, multi-tenant, and Cloud-native. There are already benchmarks and Load tests available, which show that it can handle a million Postgres connections on a cluster and it can absorb millions of connections, making it a great choice for developers connecting to Postgres from Serverless environments. Future work includes load balancing, session pooling, Postgres high-availability management, and APIs like Postgres binary, HTTPS, and much more. José Valim and the Dashbit team helped inform the Supavisor design decisions, and it is inspired by products like PgBouncer, Amazon RDS Proxy, Google Cloud SQL Proxy, and more.

Supabase CEO introduces Supavisor, a Postgres connection pooler built with Elixir, highlighting its similarity to Pgbouncer and designed for multi-tenancy. Supavisor's benchmarks indicate it can handle high throughput while consuming 7.8G RAM and ~50% CPU on a 64vCPU machine. Supabase plans to have Supavisor in front of all its databases, scaling-up computing with zero downtime. Discussion Service users request the addition of prepared statements in transaction pooling mode and suggestion of using Nimble_pool rather than Poolboy, while praising Elixir's concurrency support and fault-tolerant nature. One Discussion Service user shares work experience with Pgbouncer on 4 vCPU machines and another talks about their pool of common Pgbouncers that route to various PostgreSQL instances using Google's Cloud SQL proxy.

### New allegations of plagiarism against Roy Lichtenstein

[Original](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/09/new-allegations-of-plagiarism-against-roy-lichtenstein).
New allegations of plagiarism have been made against Roy Lichtenstein, with a new film claiming that hundreds of his works can be traced to other artists. The documentary alleges that over 30 comic artists were "appropriated" by the founder of the pop art movement, who made millions from selling his work, whilst the original artists who were copied lived austere and even destitute lives. While some defend Lichtenstein's work as "appropriation", critics call it stealing, with "outright plagiarisms" cited alongside "technically and artistically" superior works copied by Lichtenstein.
